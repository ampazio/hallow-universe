# hallow-universe
Our project "The Hallow App Universe: Analyzing a Mediatized Religious World through the Lens of Deep Mediatization", conducted under the auspices of an IDUB grant at the University of Warsaw, seeks to examine how a changing media environment â€“ which now includes religious apps - impacts communicative practices within the religious domain. Accordingly, we seek to examine (1) how various types of actors are mobilized to participate in Hallow's communicative universe and what relationships are constituted between them, (2) what narratives emerge as prominent within Hallow's public communication, (3) how communicative practices are reconfigured within Hallow, and (4) how Hallow itself emerges as a mediator between the religious and the secular domains.

Our analysis included:

1) a digital ethnography of the app
2) co-occurence analysis of actors mentioned in Hallow's public communication, visualized through Gephi software and interpreted via the lens of visual network analysis
3) thematic analysis and directed content analysis of a qualitative corpus
4) text mining

The material uploaded here includes: 
1) Python scripts used to apply the NER function to our qualitative data in order to extract a list of relevant entities
2) Direct results of the co-occurence analysis of the aformentioned entities in .csv format
3) Results of the co-occurence analysis in the form of nodes.csv and edges.csv files compatible with Gephi software
4) Python scripts converting the initial .csv Excel output into the nodes and edges format
