4 Ways to Grow in Prayer After College

I attended a Catholic college where every dorm had a chapel, the church bells rang out the hours, and it was normal to see priests strolling across campus. Dorm Mass, campus ministry retreats, and deep talks about God were as central to my college experience as dining hall dinners, staying up far too late to write papers, and running across the quad to make it to class on time.

When I left college to pursue my first adult job, I panicked. Suddenly I was living alone, far away from my best friends, in a city I had visited once. Instead of leaning on God, I tried to figure it all out on my own. And I had no idea what to do.

Not everyone had the same college experience I had ‚Äì some of you might have been at public schools, some of you might have been really involved in your Newman Center or Campus Ministry, some of you might have entered the Church during your time at college, some of you might have not gone to any church service these past four years.

Whatever the case, prayer life after college is a whole new mountain to climb, and it can be both a great adventure and a huge struggle.

Here are four quick pieces of advice I received post-graduation that helped me as I transitioned from college student to working adult:

Remember it is going to be different.

I constantly compared my new life to my old college life. I grieved not living with my best friends. I missed nightly Mass. I missed the feeling that I belonged in a place.

A good friend reminded me that it was okay to be freaked out by change. But change is part of life. As you encounter life‚Äôs changes during post-grad life, don‚Äôt be discouraged if your prayer life changes too. It should! As we mature and encounter new experiences, our prayer life should mature and change along with us.

I might not be going to daily night Mass in a dorm with my friends anymore, but I have gotten to read some amazing books, I‚Äôve gotten to have conversations that have taught me more about God, I‚Äôve gotten to witness God‚Äôs love in the people I work with. It‚Äôs different, but it‚Äôs just as good and challenging.

Join a church.

I traveled for my first job and would go to whatever church I could make it to each Sunday. I knew I should join a church, but I didn‚Äôt really get why.

About a year ago I finally joined a church. I wish I could say that it totally transformed my life, but honestly it didn‚Äôt. What it did do was encourage me to start financially giving to the church, to gradually get to know people‚Äôs names around me, to notice areas of need that I could fill.

I started to feel like something bigger than myself. Unlike in college, I was surrounded by people of different ages ‚Äì elderly people, middle-aged people, kids, babies, young families.  I could look around and see the vastness of the Church, and see the small role I could play in it.

So take the plunge. Register to be a member. Try to go to the same Mass every week. Get involved, and see what happens.

Dig into a community.

Community is so, so important. But it‚Äôs also hard to find. Two pieces of advice here:

First, keep up with your old friends that encourage you. Becoming long-distance friends is a tough transition, but technology makes it so much easier. Some ideas on how to do this:

Read a book together (I recommend I Believe in Love by Jean C.J. d‚ÄôElbee, or anything by C.S. Lewis) and have a weekly or monthly call about it. Make a group text ‚Äì on Mondays, you ask how you can pray for each other during the week, then on Fridays share how your week went Find an app that connects you ‚Äì I‚Äôll throw in a plug here for Hallow, where you‚Äôll find guided prayer and meditation sessions, and then talk with your friends about how God is working in your life.

Secondly, find a community where you are. As tempting as it is to cling to old friendships, we need to interact with people in person. Join a young adult group, volunteer at a Catholic Worker, push yourself to talk about God with others. And don‚Äôt be turned off by someone who isn‚Äôt Catholic ‚Äì one of my best friends is agnostic, two of them are Protestant ‚Äì and all three have helped me grow closer to God. So invite that coworker you click with to coffee, no matter what their faith background is ‚Äì you might be surprised by how you can encourage each other in your faith journeys.

Set aside time each day to pray.

We hear this a lot, that prayer takes discipline. And it really, really does. Just as we take care of our mind and body, we need to take care of our soul.

One simple way that has helped me set aside time is to consider my mornings as coffee dates with a friend. Spending fifteen minutes reading the Gospel, journaling, or just being with God while I sip my coffee sets my whole day on the right track.

Other ways include stopping by a chapel on your lunch break, going to daily Mass, turning off the radio and praying on your commute, praying as you run or go for a walk, or winding down your day with prayer before bed. Check out spiritual books, download an app, start a prayer journal, and seek out a spiritual advisor.

Try a few things out one at a time, and see what works for you. And remember that it might change! I‚Äôve found that some seasons of life I‚Äôve loved morning prayer, other seasons I‚Äôve leaned on daily Mass, and other seasons diving into Scripture through Lectio Divina has nurtured my spirit the most. 

Let God lead you in this, and have fun with it, knowing that you are delighting God simply by your desire to spend time with Him.

To close, know that you are not alone. Transitions are incredibly difficult, but God meets us where we are. He wants your life to be full of His joy and peace. But His plans and timing might not look like what you planned. Trust Him, enter into prayer and relationship with Him, and let Him take the lead. I promise you that you will never regret it.

How can I prepare for the Hallow Summit before attending?

We would invite you to reflect on your current prayer life and ask the Holy Spirit to reveal to you what graces you are in need of. A helpful way to do this is to pray an examination of conscience with an eye toward discovering the virtues you need to grow in or by praying an Examen in reflection of the year thus far. Coming prepared with an open mind and heart is the best way to take full advantage of the Summit. 

Do I have to be Catholic or Christian to attend?

We welcome attendees of all backgrounds regardless of where you are on your journey! The conference will be rooted in the teachings of the Catholic Church but we hope that you consider experiencing the Summit even if you are not Catholic. 

Will there be a virtual option?

Hallow is a virtual tool, but this conference is a physical in-person experience and as such we will not be offering live-streamed options.

Will there be Mass offered?

Yes, there will be Mass offered every day.

What are the meal options?

We strongly encourage all participants to purchase the food package which is $88.00 and includes Friday dinner, Saturday breakfast/lunch/dinner, and Sunday breakfast/take-home lunch.

Franciscan Square Inn and Suites Best Western Plus2. Wingate by Wyndham3. Fairfield Inn and Suites (Weirton)4. Holiday Inn and Suites (Weirton)5. Comfort Inn (Weirton)

How old must I be to attend?

The Golden Arrow Prayer is a simple yet effective prayer as a reparation for blasphemy. This prayer was revealed by Jesus to Sr. Mary of St. Peter in 1843.

May the most holy, most sacred, most adorable, most mysterious and unutterable Name of God be always praised, blessed, loved, adored and glorified in heaven, on earth and under the earth, by all the creatures of God, and by the Sacred Heart of Our Lord Jesus Christ in the most Holy Sacrament of the altar.

October 9, 2024 ‚Äî In preparation for World Mission Sunday, October 20th, The Pontifical Mission Societies USA and Hallow are excited to announce a special novena to St. Th√©r√®se of Lisieux, Patroness of the Missions. This global initiative invites the faithful to join in nine days of prayer, reflecting on the mission and spirit of St. Th√©r√®se, starting on October 11th.

Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle, pro-prefect of the Section of Evangelization of the Dicastery for Evangelization, will guide the novena in English, offering daily reflections to inspire hearts and deepen prayer. Members of the international Pontifical Mission Societies network will lead additional reflections:

Sister Regina Da Costa Pedro, National Director of TPMS Brazil, will lead the novena in Portuguese.

Father Jos√© Mar√≠a Calder√≥n, National Director of TPMS Spain, will lead the novena in Spanish.

This novena honors St. Th√©r√®se‚Äôs life and her profound dedication to spreading the Gospel through small acts of love and faith. Known for her ‚Äúlittle way,‚Äù St. Th√©r√®se continues to inspire Catholics worldwide to contribute to the Church‚Äôs missionary efforts, even in the smallest, everyday actions.

The World Mission Sunday Collection, which began in 1926, sustains the work of missionaries in Asia, Africa, Oceania, Latin America, and the Middle East. These funds support communities where the Church is young, poor, or persecuted. 

Global Participation via Hallow

The Novena will be available for free on the Hallow app, inviting participants from all over the world to pray alongside these mission leaders in their native languages. By downloading the app, users can access guided prayers, daily reflections, and special features to journey spiritually with the patroness of the missions.

The Novena will begin on October 11th and conclude on October 19th, leading up to World Mission Sunday on October 20th. St. Th√©r√®se, who is the patroness of the missions despite never having left France, remains a model of love and dedication to the Church‚Äôs global mission.

Participants can also follow the novena on The Pontifical Mission Societies‚Äô social media channels (Instagram, Facebook, X, and LinkedIn).

Hamilton, Sundays, and the Meaning of Life

I can die happy now.

I finally saw the musical Hamilton ‚Äì a hip-hop rap history lesson on the life of Alexander Hamilton, one the Founding Fathers of the United States of America.

It‚Äôs intriguing how by telling the story of any historical figure, we as the audience already know the ending of the story. (Spoiler alert!) He/she eventually dies! Alexander‚Äôs rival, Aaron Burr, puts it best when he sings, ‚ÄúDeath doesn‚Äôt discriminate / Between the sinners and the saints / It takes and it takes and it takes‚Ä¶‚Äù Death, indeed, is the one experience common to every human being.

From the opening lines of the show, we learn that all of the odds are stacked against our main protagonist. His father left. His mother passed away. His new guardian died by suicide. With nothing to his name but poverty, death looms quite large.

To Alexander, life seems capped with a strict limit. Facing the uncertain mystery of certain death, he‚Äôs not willing to ‚Äúwait for it.‚Äù There are a million things he hasn‚Äôt done, so he works ‚Äúnon-stop,‚Äù fighting and writing like he‚Äôs ‚Äúrunning out of time.‚Äù

After all is said and won, Alexander hopes that his children will, one day, tell his story. So, with a chance to leave behind a legacy and live on after death in the words of his descendants, he‚Äôs ‚Äúnot throwing away his shot.‚Äù

Grasping for immortality out of fear of death has been a perennial tendency for man since the very beginning. In the first chapters of the Book of Genesis, immediately after Adam dies the first natural death, his offspring start taking whatever they can from life. They seize power and fame, security and pleasure, and eventually make themselves into ‚Äúheroes of old,‚Äù ‚Äúmen of great renown‚Äù (Gen. 6:4).

In response, God floods the entire earth because He knows humanity‚Äôs self-led pursuits will not lead to authentic happiness. Rather, only through acceptance of their ‚Äòcreatureliness‚Äô ‚Äì with postures of humility and receptivity to God ‚Äì will they know true happiness.

To preserve this happiness for us forever, Jesus destroyed death with his own and rose from the dead. No longer was death a reason to fear. No longer was death a limit on life. Death instead became a portal, a passage into eternal life.

When God‚Äôs people were suffering in Egypt, enslaved to their work and burdened by death, He rewrote their story. He them free from captivity and led them out where they could rest from work in order to worship, especially on a specific day that He hallowed and set apart.

God intended for Sabbath rest to be a consistent foretaste of our ultimate goal: Heaven, or ‚Äúeternal rest.‚Äù

The Israelites were allowed to work for six days but not on the seventh, or else they would die (cf. Ex. 31:13-16). If any man were to neglect this sacred day of rest, he would lose sight of what truly mattered and then seek after lifeless things, things of lesser or no value.

Returning to our musical, we see how amidst politics, battles, and noise, Alexander Hamilton finally ‚Äútakes a break‚Äù to rest when his wife Eliza announces the good news ‚Äì the coming of their son. She reminds him, ‚ÄúThe fact that you‚Äôre alive is a miracle,‚Äù and she provides him consolation, saying, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt need a legacy / We don‚Äôt need money.‚Äù Simply being together ‚Äúwould be enough.‚Äù

Nonetheless, Alexander blinds himself with busyness. He excuses himself from family time and chooses to work instead. Overstressed and isolated from his community, he looks to ‚Äúbe satisfied‚Äù elsewhere. He engages in a prolonged affair, and it brings death to both his reputation and his marriage.

Alexander confronts his mortality yet again when he watches his son suffer and then breathe his last. Here, death leads Alexander properly, into a posture of stillness and silence.

Now, Alexander ‚Äútakes the children to church on Sunday,‚Äù and he prays; he admits, ‚Äúthat never used to happen before.‚Äù He also returns to his wife and stands ‚Äúby Eliza‚Äôs side.‚Äù Alexander enters into these Sabbath moments to examine himself and own up to his failings. He takes a ‚Äúlook around,‚Äù and remembers the miracle that he exists. All of this strengthens him to seek forgiveness.

Eliza, a character who has been faithful to rest and to her husband, ‚Äútakes his hand‚Äù and restores their brokenness into a new communion. For Alexander, this reconciliation with Eliza is his equivalent of the Flood of Noah‚Äôs Ark ‚Äì a clean slate, a new beginning.

Two scenes later, Eliza calls Alexander ‚Äúback to sleep;‚Äù she calls him away from work to rest. He tragically distances himself again and goes off to work instead. He slips away to duel with his rival, Aaron Burr, and what is the result?

Alexander‚Äôs ambition and pursuits lead to his untimely death.

In contrast, Eliza continues on quietly, receptive and humble. She still does not grasp for more than her portion in life. In the final song, Eliza says, ‚ÄúThe Lord, in his kindness / ‚Ä¶ He gives me more time.‚Äù She uses this time to care for orphaned children and to promote not her own story but her beloved‚Äôs.

From each Sunday lived well, peace and joy overflow into the rest of her week, and these days and weeks constitute a beautifully wholesome life. When the play ends and the curtain closes, Eliza, the only remaining Hamilton, is still alive on stage. As far as the world of theatre is concerned, she is the one who receives eternal life.

How can we hallow our Sundays and take time to consider ‚Äúwho lives, who dies, [W]ho tells our story‚Äù?

For as long as human beings have existed, we‚Äôve sought a connection to a higher power as we‚Äôve grappled with questions about our existence, purpose, and place in the universe.

Many of us learned about the gods and goddesses of Greek and Roman mythology, ancient societies that sought to make sense of the world around them. History has traced the roots of the world‚Äôs first monotheistic religion, Zoroastrianism, back as early as 1500 BC.

Pick any historical time period and region of the world, and you can almost certainly learn how religion(s) and beliefs shaped that society. 

Within all of these communal expressions of faith are individual expressions of faith and personal connections to God. If you‚Äôre wondering today how to pray, take comfort in knowing that for thousands and thousands of years, people have asked the same question.

You‚Äôre not alone!

Learning How to Pray as a Beginner

Before even considering the ‚Äúright‚Äù words or ways to pray, it‚Äôs important to recognize that even wondering how to pray is a great start. 

A desire to learn how to pray or simply even to explore what prayer‚Äôs all about is already a sign of God communicating to us through our desires. This desire can help us make time for God.

As Pope John XXIII said, ‚ÄúPrayer is the raising of the mind to God. We must always remember this. The actual words matter less.‚Äù

Often when we think of prayer, we imagine someone sitting or kneeling in perfect stillness. But this isn‚Äôt what prayer has to look like for you. Rather than focusing on what prayer looks like, allow yourself to simply create space for God to be present in your life.

Before formal prayers or rituals, one simple way to approach prayer initially is through gratitude: recognizing that there are things in life that we did nothing to deserve or earn, and to be grateful for them.

‚ÄúThe spirit of prayer gives time back to God,‚Äù Pope Francis tells us. ‚ÄúIt steps away from the obsession of a life that is always lacking time, it rediscovers the peace of necessary things, and discovers the joy of unexpected gifts.‚Äù

How to Pray to God

When the desire to pray nudges us to make time for God, the seed of prayer begins to sprout. This allows us to begin to see and hear God reaching out to us, since prayer is not a one-way line of communication.

One of the greatest living experts on prayer, Fr. Timothy Gallagher, O.M.V., is leading a prayer series on the Ignatian Spiritual Exercises for Hallow. In one of his reflections, he describes prayer as ‚Äúa relationship between two persons.‚Äù Similarly, Pope Francis speaks of prayer as a ‚Äúdialogue with God.‚Äù

Relationships are two-sided and anchored by love. In prayer ‚Äì our relationship with God ‚Äì we can receive God‚Äôs gaze and hear His voice. 

‚ÄúPrayer is always a relationship of two persons,‚Äù Fr. Gallagher reminds us.

Any prayers we recite or Scriptures we read are not merely words. They are the ways in which we engage in a dynamic relationship with a living and loving God who created us, knows us, and is truly present to us. These words of prayer and silence can help us feel God‚Äôs loving presence and hear His voice.

And when you struggle to speak, remember that God always knows what we need even when we cannot find the words ourselves.

Types of Prayer

There are numerous types of prayers that enrich the Catholic spiritual tradition. The Catechism describes different types of prayers:

Prayers of Adoration/Blessing (praising God simply for being God)

Prayers of Intercession (asking for God to help someone else)

Prayers of Petition (e.g., Prayers for Strength, Prayers for Healing, etc.)

Prayers of Thanksgiving (giving thanks to God)

We, of course, have the Lord‚Äôs Prayer, given to us by Jesus in the Bible. It‚Äôs one of the first prayers that Catholics learn and a prayer known universally by all Christians. 

Sacred music, like Gregorian chants, can also be a form of prayer. Christian prayer can draw upon specific texts and prayers that vary by season, as in the Liturgy of the Hours, or can be the recitation of or meditation on particular prayers, as with the Rosary. 

Prayer can be structured, like reflecting on daily Gospel readings with Lectio Divina, or be more open-ended, like sitting in silence with God through Christian meditation.

You might also consider praying with the Examen if you‚Äôre struggling with getting started in prayer. Your guide will lead you to reflect about your day, and you can talk with God about the good and the not-so-good moments, just as you would with a friend.

Praying to Mary and Saints (Intercessions)

Catholics don‚Äôt worship saints, including St. Mary.

When Catholics pray to and with saints, it is to ask for their intercession. We pray directly to God and worship him, but we also ask for the prayers of others in heaven, including saints.

In fact, the last line of the Hail Mary asks our Blessed Mother for her prayers:

Holy Mary, Mother of GodPray for us sinners,

Now and at the hour of our death.

Amen.

How to Begin and End Prayers

God is always open to having a dialogue with us. We can speak to Him‚Äìand listen for His gentle voice‚Äìwhenever we‚Äôd like.

Beginning prayer can be as simple as directing our heart towards God and saying, ‚ÄúHello‚Äù ‚Äì greeting Him as we would a friend or a new acquaintance.

As female doctor of the Church St. Therese of Liseux said, ‚ÄúFor me, prayer is a surge of the heart ‚Ä¶ it is a simple look turned toward heaven, it is a cry of recognition and of love, embracing both trial and joy.‚Äù

More formal prayers traditionally begin and end by making the sign of the cross and saying, ‚ÄúIn the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.‚Äù

The more that we deepen our prayer lives, the more we can become centers of ‚Äúspiritual light,‚Äù whose brightness enriches the world around us.

And, while we do begin and end prayers, we really can pray all day. Anytime we rest with God, when we create the space for His presence, we pray.

Pray As You Go

With Hallow, it‚Äôs easy to pray on the go, as you‚Äôre commuting, traveling, waking up, or getting ready for bed.

Being ‚Äútoo busy‚Äù should never prevent us from praying. God is always accessible to us and seeking to spend time with us. If you struggle to find time, consider incorporating prayer into something you already do daily: brushing your teeth, preparing your morning coffee, doing the dishes or laundry, etc. It can even be as simple as praying, ‚ÄúCome, Holy Spirit,‚Äù when you get dressed in the morning.

When you begin to pray, you‚Äôll discover how much God wants to speak with you and be present to you. And you‚Äôll become aware of His personal love for you, which gives us peace and brings meaning to our lives.

Hallow offers more than 500 prayers and meditations to help you pray, find calm, and rediscover peace‚Äìall from the convenience of your phone.

Let Hallow help you learn how to pray.

Is Technology Evil?

Erich Kerekes

Facebook

Twitter

Pinterest

Last month I had the pleasure of hearing Kevin Kelly, co-founder of the tech magazine, Wired, speak on the intersection of technology and spirituality. I walked away with a new perspective on the role tech does and could play in our spiritual growth or demise. 

His first point was that God, the ultimate Creator, made us in His image, which means that we have the same creative force within us. The cool thing about technology is that it allows us to create in our own way and live out the image of God even more fully.

Well, if you reacted to this as I did, you may have thought of a million examples of technology that are not reflective of the image of God. Kelly‚Äôs response to this was that, while technology has the capacity for both good and evil, it is primarily up to the user to determines which ‚Äì not the nature of the tech itself. The underlying technology itself isn‚Äôt good or evil, it‚Äôs how we use it and interact with it.

Take, for instance, the chemical DDT. Initially sprayed on plantations, DDT proved to be a severe health concern and could have easily been written off as an evil innovation. However, as Kelly pointed out, it was later discovered that when used in small doses in areas susceptible to malaria, it can be used safely to save millions of lives.

This extends to the technology that has become so ingrained in our daily lives: computers, televisions, and, of course, smart phones. I‚Äôm afraid that, in most cases today, technology is used in a way that pulls us away from God. Beyond the explicitly harmful ways to use a computer or phone, there is also the subtler danger of constant distraction. I struggle with this as much as anyone. It can be so easy to get caught up in emails, on Facebook, or to fall into the crazy YouTube spiral of related videos. Consequently, it is not uncommon for us at Hallow to be asked ‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt we be trying to pull people away from their phones, instead of encouraging them to use them even more? How will another app help?‚Äù

I believe the answer lies in the DDT analogy. Technology is a tool. We can either use it for harm or for good. We can use technology to video call an out-of-town friend and strengthen a relationship, or social media to find a community where we truly feel supported. In fact, I wouldn‚Äôt have even heard Kevin Kelly‚Äôs talk without technology, nor could I be sharing these thoughts with you now. With Hallow, we hope to provide a way to use our phones for growth with God. Ironically, we‚Äôre trying to use our phones as a way to step away from our phones and step towards God. You open the app, press play, put your phone aside, close your eyes, and fully and completely focus on God. 

For better or worse, technology isn‚Äôt going anywhere. I‚Äôd be shocked if people spend any less time on a computer or a phone 50 years from now. So, if we can‚Äôt get rid of technology, let‚Äôs see if we can take some small steps to change the way we interact with it. I look forward to the day that the instinct is to look at technology and see, first and foremost, an aid to spirituality and human growth.

My Journey From Atheist to Maybe a Christian Pt. 1

Alex Jones

Facebook

Twitter

Pinterest

As I discussed in our e-book, 3 ways to renew your prayer life, my faith journey has been one of re-discovery. The first step for me in this re-discovery was mostly intellectual: the cracking open of the door to the possibility that this whole Christianity thing might not all be nonsense.

I do want to call out, though, that the step after this ‚Äòcracking open of the door‚Äô was to me what has been even more impactful: the exploration and discovery of my prayer life and of a personal relationship with God. I am still very much at the beginning of both of these journeys. The one thing I‚Äôve learned so far is just how much more I still have to learn.

For the purposes of this post, though, I‚Äôll take a stab at a very simple view of some of the arguments that helped me when I was first exploring the Christian faith.

One other caveat: I am in no way a trained theologian, philosopher or physicist. There are many who have written and articulated this more beautifully and precisely than I will here.

The Dismantling

The first step in this journey is what I would call the dismantling. Throughout most of high school and college, I was an atheist. I was the kind of person who only believed in what we could prove with science. But a question kept coming up as I started to explore my newfound belief system: ‚ÄòIf science is my new system of truth how can I be sure, unlike these religions I‚Äôve abandoned, that science is true?‚Äô

My view at that point was essentially ‚Äòscience may never lead us 100% to the truth, but as we progress it gets us closer and closer ‚Äì it narrows in on truth or the correct world view.‚Äô But as I started to look at it in depth, this view started to fall apart. Take for instance the evolution of the concept of gravity. During Newton‚Äôs time, we thought gravity was some kind of force that moved and flowed around invisibly. Then Einstein said it was really more like we‚Äôre all sitting on a trampoline and as we get heavier we bend and warp the trampoline (i.e., space-time). Now in quantum mechanics, we apparently have something called a graviton, which is some kind of massless string? I just kept thinking about how radically different these three world views were. Could I really see any kind of linear evolution? The same is true when you look at almost any other major theory in science, e.g., particle physics, light, time.

Needless to say, I was a bit shaken in my ‚Äòbelief‚Äô in science, so I started to dig deeper and take a class on the philosophy of science. One of the readings (by David Hume ‚Äì a philosopher in the 18th century) started to address this issue head on. He essentially broke down reasoning into two types: deduction, which is what we think of as logic and math (e.g., the statement ‚Äúif all walls are white, and this is a wall, then it must be white‚Äù) and induction which is the idea that because something happened the same way 100 times previously (and assuming all else equal) we believe it will continue to happen the same way tomorrow and the next day (e.g., gravity, science, evidence).

The problem with both of these is that we can‚Äôt prove logically that either one leads us to truth. The only way to prove one of them is by using itself or the other, which is a circular argument (i.e., you can‚Äôt prove deduction works with logic or that induction works by pointing to past evidence).

My first reaction to this argument was something like, ‚ÄúWell if I wake up every day and drop my pen to the floor, then every day I collect another data point that the pen will fall to the floor in the future, right? Each time I drop it, I get a little bit closer to knowing for certain that it will drop tomorrow.‚Äù

The issue is that the future is unknown, even potentially infinite. Just because I dropped the pen 100 times, or even if all of humanity for the history of the world dropped the pen millions of times, it doesn‚Äôt mean that it‚Äôs close to even half of all of the pen drops that will ever occur. David Hume‚Äôs argument in his work A Treatise of Human Nature can be summarized with the example of the black swan. For years and years the western world thought all swans were white. All they had ever seen were white swans, but then in 1697 the Dutch explorer Willem de Vlamingh discovered black swans in Australia and the white swan rule (formed by induction) was completely incorrect. As Hume writes, ‚ÄúNo amount of observations of white swans can allow the inference that all swans are white, but the observation of a single black swan is sufficient to refute that conclusion.‚Äù  Bertrand Russell emphasizes the same point in his Problems of Philosophy as he writes:

‚ÄúDomestic animals expect food when they see the person who usually feeds them. We know that all these rather crude expectations of uniformity are liable to be misleading. The man who has fed the chicken every day throughout its life at last wrings its neck instead, showing that more refined views as to the uniformity of nature would have been useful to the chicken.‚Äù

But, I thought, we have pretty much seen the whole world by now, right? No way something will come up and surprise us or contradict our theories at this point. Except no scientist would ever agree with this ‚Äì we haven‚Äôt even mapped or classified 1% of the observable universe.

The broader theme was that it was starting to seem like nothing, not even science, stood on as solid of ground as I had thought. And I began to realize that it was never meant to. The majority of scientists never claimed it did. They admire science simply for what it is: a simple set of steps (i.e., the scientific method) meant to rigorously study and theorize about a set of observed experiences. It was never meant to stand on its own as a philosophy of life. In fact, when I started to think about it, really every other form of knowledge fell under the same umbrella. Nothing really stood on its own solid ground. In fact, I began to think, what goes to show that anything exists at all? Couldn‚Äôt we just be in a dream or a computer simulation (kudos to Elon Musk)? Is there such thing as reality or truth?

Faith

And so it was torn down. Everything I thought I knew was dismantled. And that‚Äôs when I started to see an old word in a new light: faith.

I started to see that ‚Äì regardless of whether I was atheist, agnostic, Buddhist or Christian ‚Äì there were certain fundamental assumptions that you just had to take a bet on. There was no way to ever really ‚Äòknow‚Äô them. Things like, ‚ÄúIs there an objective truth?‚Äù, ‚ÄúIs the world real?‚Äù, ‚ÄúDoes our logic and induction lead us toward understanding?‚Äù cannot be proven.

And I started to think that maybe this was what these Christians meant by faith after all: making a bet on an interpretation of the world that you choose to live in.

I started thinking about which questions I would have to take a bet on. Questions of truth, reason, and free will. Questions of hope, beauty and values. And for some reason, one had always stuck out to me more than the rest: the question, ‚ÄúIs there such a thing as love, and does it matter?‚Äù The decision between two worlds: (a) one in which love is a series of chemical reactions in our brains that we have no control over or (b) one in which love is somehow something more.

And that‚Äôs when I stumbled upon the book Doing the Truth in Love by Michael J. Himes, and he pushed me to think through something pretty powerful. He pushed me to realize that the God that Christians believe in can most simply and least incorrectly be understood as choice (b). But instead of just saying that there is love, they say He is love. Not only is there something more to love than just chemicals, but it is apparently the most important thing there is or could ever be.

For the first time, I started to get excited. I started to see a glimpse of what the word ‚ÄòGod‚Äô could actually mean. I started to think about the bet I wanted to make. The bet on which world I wanted to believe in. The bet against the world of chemicals, determinism and machines, and instead for a world of Love.

At this point in time, I was still a million miles away from the God that Christians believed in. I had no idea what this whole thing about the Eucharist was, what baptism was supposed to do, or anything about what this whole three-person / trinity thing was supposed to mean. But it was starting to show some promise, and so I decided to again dig deeper. I realized that the next big question all hinged on this Jesus guy everyone kept talking about. And so that‚Äôs where I went to next.

My Journey From Atheist to Maybe a Christian Pt. 2

Alex Jones

This post is a continuation of the discussion that began in an earlier blog post about my journey toward becoming a Christian. It picks up where the first left off. 

Jesus

There was something about this guy that always seemed to resonate with me. Every time I‚Äôd heard something from the Gospels, it felt like Jesus was saying something pretty dope, but I never really dug in. I had taken the stance that many do: that He was a great moral teacher, but that I didn‚Äôt really buy Him being the Son of the Creator of the universe. And that‚Äôs when I started reading another phenomenal book: Mere Christianity by C.S. Lewis.

Lewis said something that I found tremendously interesting: that if you actually read the Gospels, you find that Jesus said a lot of things that weren‚Äôt just moral teachings. In fact, a lot of what He says centers around Him being divine e.g.,

Jesus said to him, ‚ÄúI am the way, the truth, and the life. No one can come to the Father except through me.‚Äù (John 14:6)

‚ÄúVery truly I tell you,‚Äù Jesus answered, ‚Äúbefore Abraham was born, I am!‚Äù (John 8:58)

He said to them, ‚ÄúYou are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.‚Äù (John 8:23)

Jesus said to her, ‚ÄúI am the resurrection and the life. Those who believe in me, even though they die, will live‚Äù (John 11:25)

‚ÄúI am the resurrection and the life. Those who believe in me, even though they die, will live‚Äù (John 11:25)

Jesus replied, ‚ÄúI am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never be hungry again. Whoever believes in me will never be thirsty.‚Äù (John 6:35)

Could you imagine me saying those things to you today? You‚Äôd think I was insane.

What if you stole something from your friend and then came to me, and I said ‚ÄòOh don‚Äôt worry, I forgive you for it.‚Äô What a ridiculous statement that would be. How could I possibly forgive you for wrongs against someone else? The only way that would make any sense was if I was the person primarily wronged. If I was in some sense the main counter-party in every wrong. It would only make sense if I was God. This was what Lewis explains when he writes:

‚ÄúI am trying here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish thing that people often say about Him: I‚Äôm ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don‚Äôt accept his claim to be God. That is the one thing we must not say. A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic ‚Äî on the level with the man who says he is a poached egg ‚Äî or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or something worse. You can shut him up for a fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God, but let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to.‚Äù

Following this book‚Äôs train of thought, another providential piece of content was shepherded my way ‚Äì the movie The Case For Christ. It‚Äôs an amazing portrait of a skeptic‚Äôs exploration of the truth behind the resurrection. To make a long story short, it all goes back to trusting what people have said. We trust in almost every piece of history and knowledge we learn (e.g., that Socrates existed) with much less historical evidence and written accounts than we have of Jesus‚Äô resurrection. But what if they only wrote these accounts to trick us? But then we have to ask ‚Äì for what purpose? Many of these early Christians were tortured and killed for their beliefs. If you‚Äôre interested in digging into the historical evidence, the late Pastor Billy Graham does a great job here.

And this brings us all the way back to the beginning of the first post in this series. All of these things together ‚Äì the thinking about truth, about faith, about God, about Jesus ‚Äì these all led to the cracking open of the door. I was now at a point where I could see a world in which I might be able to buy that there was some kind of God out there, and that He may or may not have something to do with this guy named Jesus.

The big missing piece to me now was that apparently you‚Äôre supposed to be able to have some kind of personal relationship with this guy. To talk to Him. To be friends with Him ‚Äì here and now. Not in some kind of ethereal philosophical sense, but in the real world today.

This is the journey I‚Äôve been on for the past few years, and I‚Äôm only just at the beginning. It‚Äôs what we‚Äôre focused on here at Hallow: finding ways to discover and build this relationship with God. I invite you to join us by downloading our app and trying out some of our guided prayer and meditation sessions.

My Top 3 Gifts for Catholics This Easter

Looking for great Catholic gifts for Easter, Confirmation, or just because?

As I think back to the gifts that I received for Easter over the last 26 years of my life, they‚Äôve largely fallen into one major category: bunny-shaped candy. Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, I absolutely love my chocolate bunnies (and peanut butter cups). But recently, as I‚Äôve been thinking about Easter gifts for my family this year ‚Äì admittedly it‚Äôs coming down to the wire now ‚Äì a thought crossed my mind: what could I give my friends and family members that is actually related to the holiday? In other words, what gifts could I give that could help others grow in their faith lives?

So I started looking around and have been pleasantly surprised by some of the amazing resources that I‚Äôve found out there, and knew I had to share a few of the newest ones with you. I‚Äôll keep this short and to the point so I‚Äôll just share my top 3.

First is a beautiful Mass journal called Every Sacred Sunday. Every Sacred Sunday provides the Gospel reading for every Sunday‚Äôs Mass and is complete with gorgeous hand-drawn illustrations and a place to take notes, allowing you to both better prepare for the Mass, and to respond and reflect more deeply afterwards.

Second is a list of some of my favorite books. There are countless great books out there that have helped me grow in my faith life, dating all the way back to some classics written by saints hundreds of years ago such as Confessions by St. Augustine, Interior Castle by St. Teresa of √Åvila, and Ascent of Mt. Carmel by St. John of the Cross.

But new books are always coming out as well and two have even come out this very month that I would highly recommend reading: the first is The Catholic Gentleman: Living Authentic Manhood Today by Samuel Guzman, and the second is The 5 Habits of Prayerful People by Michael St. Pierre. Both of these books are extremely helpful in learning how to grow in holiness and in a relationship with God while living in today‚Äôs world.

Lastly, as I‚Äôm sure you saw the shameless plug coming from a mile away, you can never go wrong with giving the gift of Catholic Meditation through a Hallow gift card! Great news is they come instantly to your inbox after purchase, so it‚Äôs no problem if you procrastinated your shopping this year just like I did.

This only scratches the surface of the huge world of wonderful Catholic gifts that exist out there, but I hope it gives you a few ideas for how we can use this time of year (or any occasion at all!) to help one another grow spiritually. If you‚Äôve got any ideas that we missed, please feel free to leave them in a comment below!

Also, I hope this goes without saying, but please don‚Äôt feel like these have to replace the chocolate bunny, they can always just be added on instead üôÇ After all, Easter is a feast day and those magnificent candies aren‚Äôt exactly available year-round.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äì

Quick disclaimer as I‚Äôve seen the question come up a lot for similar posts before: this is not a sponsored post, and the owners of these products were not aware that I was writing it or would be mentioning them. I do know some of the folks behind these amazing products ‚Äì I find their faith and ministries truly inspirational ‚Äì but wrote about them because I genuinely believe you‚Äôll find them to be powerful aids for spiritual growth üôÇ

Prayers for Peace: Peace of Mind, Peace in the World and More

Stephen Spiewak

Facebook

Twitter

Pinterest

Peace is fundamental to the Christian faith.

In the book of the prophet Isaiah, long before Jesus‚Äôs birth, we learn of his title of Prince of Peace.

‚ÄúFor a child, is born to us, a son is given to us; upon his shoulder dominion rests. They name him Wonder-Counselor, God-Hero, Father-Forever, Prince of Peace.‚Äù ~ Isaiah 9:5

In the Gospels, Jesus Himself tells us that he offers us peace.

I leave with you; my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give it to you. Do not let your hearts be troubled or afraid. ~ John 14:27

We logically know Jesus brings us peace. Yet, both in the world around us and inside our own hearts and minds, it is sometimes difficult to recognize that peace.

Here are some prayers you can use to pray for peace, whether you‚Äôre seeking peace in our world or peace in your mind. 

Prayers for Peace

Hallow created these simple prayers for peace that you can pray to ask God for peace on earth, in the many forms that that takes.

If you are using these prayers in a group setting, simply change the singular pronouns (‚ÄúI‚Äù and ‚Äúme‚Äù) to plural ones (like ‚Äúwe‚Äù and ‚Äúus‚Äù).

You may also find these prayers helpful for praying for peace within families.

Heavenly Father, you created the earth, the sun, and all of the life that dwells here as part of your creation. I pray that your Holy Spirit may move the hearts of all of Your children toward a radical form of peace that rejects violence and oppression. I understand, o Lord, that conflicts have existed for centuries and can seem impossibly complex and without hope. However, You are a God of peace and healing. Through You, all things are possible. Heal our world. May Your Kingdom come. Amen. 

God of peace and justice, I turn to You today with a heavy heart, overwhelmed by the division and unrest that distances us from each other‚Äìand from You. Soften the hearts of those who see their brother as ‚Äúother‚Äù. Remind us all that you call us to live in harmony with each other. May pride never overtake us. May we live to serve, putting others before ourselves. God, may Your peace reign now and forever. Amen.

Dear God, we know you have conquered the world, including death, and all of the evil that sometimes feels like it surrounds us. In moments like this, where I desperately seek peace, I pray that I can take comfort in Your promise and place my trust in You. I pray that I not only feel Your love but that I become an instrument of it, extending Your loving embrace to those whose lives are most shattered by the sins of violence. In Your name I pray. Amen.

Holy Spirit come, guide us towards the way of peace. Lead us to build God‚Äôs kingdom here on earth. Set our hearts ablaze with a fire for justice. Strengthen us in our mission to follow the path that God leads us toward. I pray for hope, I pray for kindness, I pray for justice. I pray for all these things as I pray for peace. In Jesus‚Äôs name I pray. Amen.

Prayers for Peace of Mind 

Sometimes the peace we desire has less to do with what‚Äôs happening out in the world, and what‚Äôs happening in the complicated space inside our heads.

If you‚Äôve ever been overcome by worrying, overthinking, restlessness or any other feelings that have left you feeling unsettled, you know that peace of mind is not always easy to come by.

Consider these short prayers whenever you need peace of mind, whether you‚Äôre lying in bed struggling to sleep or feeling a lack of peace amid the busyness of your day.

When my mind races and my heart is unsettled, Lord, I turn to you. Settle my uneasy mind and strengthen me that I may fix my eyes on You and the promise of eternal life secured through Jesus‚Äôs victory over death. I love You, Lord, and I trust in You. In Your name I pray. Amen.

Heavenly Father, Your love for me knows no bounds. You sent Your Son so that I may live forever with you in heaven. Right now, heaven feels far away, and I struggle to feel the peace that I know You provide. Let my mind be calm, my heart be still. Help me to feel Your presence with me now. Clear my mind of worries and fill it with the peace only You provide. In gratitude I pray. Amen. 

Jesus, you calmed the stormy waters in the Sea of Galilee. I imagine how the disciples felt in the boat, far from the safety of dry land, dealing with choppy, turbulent waves, unable to feel peace. It‚Äôs a feeling I relate to now. I turn to You as I navigate the storm in my mind and ask You to make it still. Grant me peace, that I may feel rest. You are with me in stormy waters just like You are in the beautiful, still waters of my life. No matter the storm around me, grant that my mind may feel Your peace, trusting in You entirely.

Papal Prayers for Peace in the World

Across centuries, the Holy See has led the faithful around the world in prayers for peace.

Sometimes, this has been in response to specific instances of war and violence around the world.

Other times, these prayers for peace have been general invocations aiming to help God‚Äôs peace flourish here on earth.

The amazing thing about these prayers from popes is that, while they are rooted in specific periods of time, they feel just as relevant today in many ways.

Consider the words below, the concluding lines of a prayer from St. Benedict XVI in 1915, following the outbreak of World War I:

This is the cry of peace which breaks forth from Our heart with added vehemence on this mournful day; and We invite all, whosoever are the friends of peace the world over, to give Us a helping hand in order to hasten the termination of the war, which for a long year has changed Europe into one vast battlefield. May the merciful Jesus, through the intercession of His Sorrowful Mother, grant that at last, after so horrible a storm, the dawn of peace may break, placid and radiant, an image of His own Divine Countenance. May hymns of thanksgiving soon rise to the Most High, the Giver of all good things, for the accomplished reconciliation of the States; may the peoples, bound in bonds of brotherly love, return to the peaceful rivalry of studies, of arts, of industries, and, with the empire of right reestablished, may they resolve from now henceforth to entrust the settlement of their differences, not to the sword‚Äôs edge, but to reasons of equity and justice, pondered with due cairn and deliberation. This will be their most splendid and glorious conquest! In loving trust that the tree of peace may soon return to rejoice the world with such desirable fruits, We impart the Apostolic Benediction to all who make up the mystical flock confided to Us, and also for those, who do not yet belong to the Church of Rome, We pray the Lord to draw them close to Us in the bonds of perfect charity.

Similarly, in 1961, Pope John XIII issued this prayer for peace during the Cold War. See the prayer in its entirety here, or spend in time prayer with the final section of it, featured below: 

We would extend our most urgent invitation to prayer to priests, to consecrated souls, to the innocent and to the suffering. Let us all together beg the Father of light and of grace to enlighten the minds and move the wills of those who hold the chief responsibility for the life or death of the peoples; let us pray for the peoples themselves that they may not allow themselves to be dazzled by exacerbated nationalism and destructive rivalry, and that, as We so earnestly exhorted in Our Encyclical ‚ÄúMater et Magistra‚Äù, the relationships in the life of human society may be reintegrated in truth, in justice and in love. Let us all pray that by means of the penetration of the Christian spirit morality may grow strong: the vigorous strength of Christian families, the source of noble power and dignity and of blessed and joyful prosperity. Ever and always let us pray for the peace of Christ here below, between all men of good will: ‚Äúthat all the families of the nations, rent asunder by the wound of sin, may be subjected to the most gentle rule of Christ.‚Äù And finally we turn to you, O blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of Jesus and our Mother also. How can we, with trembling hearts, apply ourselves to this greatest problem of life or death, which overshadows all mankind, without relying on your intercession to keep us safe from all dangers? This is your hour, Mary; to you Jesus entrusted us in the final moment of His sacrifice of blood. We are confident in your intercession.On the Eighth of September Holy Church kept the feast of your most happy birthday, hailing it as the first beginning of the world‚Äôs salvation and the growth of peace. This indeed, is what we beg of you, most loving Mother and Queen of all the world. The world has no need of victorious wars and defeated peoples, but of the renewed strength of salvation and of the fruitfulness and calm of peace: this is its need and this it is for which it cries aloud: ‚Äúsalutis exordum; et pacis incrementum‚Äù; ‚Äúthe dawn of salvation and growth of peace. Amen. Amen.‚Äù

On World Day of Peace (January 1) in 2006, Pope Benedict XVI prayed for peace through the intercession of Mary, Mother of the Prince of Peace. The full prayer is available here, with the ending excerpt included below: 

At the same time I ask for an increase of prayers, since peace is above all a gift of God, a gift to be implored incessantly. By God‚Äôs help, our proclamation and witness to the truth of peace will be all the more convincing and illuminating. With confidence and filial abandonment let us lift up our eyes to Mary, Mother of the Prince of Peace. At the beginning of this New Year, let us ask her to help all God‚Äôs People, wherever they may be, to work for peace and to be guided by the light of the truth that sets man free (cf. Jn 8:32). Through Mary‚Äôs intercession, may all mankind grow in esteem for this fundamental good and strive to make it ever more present in our world, and, in this way, to offer a safer and more serene future to generations yet to come.

In 2014, Pope Francis issued an invocation for peace at the Vatican Gardens. Following a trip to the Holy Land, he invited Israeli and Palestinian leaders together and called for peace, a message that certainly resonates a decade later:

Lord God of peace, hear our prayer! We have tried so many times and over so many years to resolve our conflicts by our own powers and by the force of our arms. How many moments of hostility and darkness have we experienced; how much blood has been shed; how many lives have been shattered; how many hopes have been buried‚Ä¶ But our efforts have been in vain. Now, Lord, come to our aid! Grant us peace, teach us peace; guide our steps in the way of peace. Open our eyes and our hearts, and give us the courage to say: ‚ÄúNever again war!‚Äù; ‚ÄúWith war everything is lost‚Äù. Instil in our hearts the courage to take concrete steps to achieve peace. Lord, God of Abraham, God of the Prophets, God of Love, you created us and you call us to live as brothers and sisters. Give us the strength daily to be instruments of peace; enable us to see everyone who crosses our path as our brother or sister. Make us sensitive to the plea of our citizens who entreat us to turn our weapons of war into implements of peace, our trepidation into confident trust, and our quarreling into forgiveness. Keep alive within us the flame of hope, so that with patience and perseverance we may opt for dialogue and reconciliation. In this way may peace triumph at last, and may the words ‚Äúdivision‚Äù, ‚Äúhatred‚Äù and ‚Äúwar‚Äù be banished from the heart of every man and woman. Lord, defuse the violence of our tongues and our hands. Renew our hearts and minds, so that the word which always brings us together will be ‚Äúbrother‚Äù, and our way of life will always be that of: Shalom, Peace, Salaam! Amen.

Bible Verses for Peace

When you‚Äôre seeking peace, it can be comforting to simply spend time with the Word of God. 

Here are some portions of Scripture you can reflect on and pray with during times where you‚Äôre struggling to feel peace.

The Psalms are filled with beautiful words that tell of the peace that only God can provide. 

Pslam 124 is one such example:

A song of ascents. Of David.

Had not the Lord been with us,

    let Israel say,

Had not the Lord been with us,

    when people rose against us,

Then they would have swallowed us alive,

    for their fury blazed against us.

Then the waters would have engulfed us,

    the torrent overwhelmed us;

then seething water would have drowned us.

Blessed is the Lord, who did not leave us

    to be torn by their teeth.

We escaped with our lives like a bird

    from the fowler‚Äôs snare;

    the snare was broken,

    and we escaped.

Our help is in the name of the Lord,

    the maker of heaven and earth.

This passage from Joshua reminds us that God is faithful to His promise to us, giving His people peace ‚Äúon every side.‚Äù

And so the Lord gave Israel the entire land he had sworn to their ancestors he would give them. Once they had taken possession of it, and dwelt in it, the Lord gave them peace on every side, just as he had promised their ancestors. Not one of their enemies could withstand them; the Lord gave all their enemies into their power. Not a single word of the blessing that the Lord had promised to the house of Israel failed; it all came true. ~ Joshua 21:43-45

Consider this passage from 1 Kings, which reminds us that when everything around us feels like chaos, God is present with us in the peace of silence.

Then the Lord said: Go out and stand on the mountain before the Lord; the Lord will pass by. There was a strong and violent wind rending the mountains and crushing rocks before the Lord‚Äîbut the Lord was not in the wind; after the wind, an earthquake‚Äîbut the Lord was not in the earthquake; after the earthquake, fire‚Äîbut the Lord was not in the fire; after the fire, a light silent sound. ~ 1 Kings 19:11-12

Bible Verses for Protection

Scripture gives us countless examples of God‚Äôs protection, starting with the book of Genesis.

Chapter 22 of Genesis contains the famous story of God testing Abraham through Isaac‚Äôs sacrifice. Before Abraham actually harmed Isaac, God commanded Abraham to not lay a hand on his son.

God protected Isaac. And He protected Daniel in the lion‚Äôs den. He safeguarded the Holy Family from Herod.

Today, too, God protects us. His protection and safeguarding didn‚Äôt exist only during Biblical times. He continues to watch over us today.

Pope Benedict the XVI once said, ‚ÄúGod will protect us with love at every moment, guarding our lives from every evil.‚Äù

Consider these prayers for protection, which you can pray at any time.

Short Prayers for Protection and Safety

Come Holy Spirit, be my Guide. Open my eyes and move my heart to follow the path the Father calls me toward. Protect me from evil and temptation. Strengthen me that my heart may remain pure.

Jesus, through your sacrifice, death and Resurrection, you defeated death and secured for us the promise of eternal life. I ask you today to help me remember that as I encounter any struggles, dangers, or challenges this day here on earth. Give me courage, knowing death will never win. Give me comfort, remembering Your love for me, knowing You gave everything for me. Be with me, now and always. Amen.

Heavenly Father, I come to You today humbly seeking your protection, for me, my family and all of those close to me. Keep us safe while we‚Äôre awake and watch over us as we sleep. Assured of your love, I pray for the courage to live boldly, unafraid of challenges or dangers I may face. Strengthen me, O God, to follow your call to love and serve more fully than many will understand. In Your name I pray.

Lord, you are my refuge and my fortress. I place my trust in you. Be with me today and protect me from all harm. May the wings of Your angels rescue me from danger. I cling to you now and always, knowing you are near to me in moments of suffering or danger. With a grateful heart, I pray. Amen. (inspired by Psalm 91)

Prayer for Protection from Violence and Terrorism 

To pray for protection from the thread of violence and terrorism, consider this prayer courtesy of Pope Francis. Pope Francis shared this prayer in 2016 while making an unexpected visit to a Polish church to pray before relics of two martyrs who were victims of political violence.

He offered the following prayer for protection from violence: 

‚ÄúO almighty and merciful God, Lord of the universe and of history. All that You have created is good and your compassion for the mistakes of mankind knows no limits. We come to You today to ask You to keep in peace the world and its people, to keep far away from it the devastating wave of terrorism, to restore friendship and instill in the hearts of Your creatures the gift of trust and of readiness to forgive.

O Giver of life, we pray to You also for all those who have died as victims of brutal terrorist attacks. Grant them their eternal reward. May they intercede for the world that is torn apart by conflicts and disagreements. O Jesus, Prince of Peace, we pray to You for the ones who have been wounded in these acts of inhuman violence: children and young people, old people and innocent people accidentally involved in evil. Heal their bodies and hearts; console them with Your strength and, at the same time, take away any hatred and a desire for revenge.

Holy Spirit Consoler, visit the families of the victims of terrorism, families that suffer through no fault of their own. Wrap them in the mantle of Your divine mercy. Make them find again in You and in themselves the strength and courage to continue to be brothers and sisters for others, above all for immigrants, giving witness to Your love by their lives.

Touch the hearts of terrorists so that they may recognise the evil of their actions and may turn to the way of peace and goodness, of respect for the life and for the dignity of every human being, regardless of religion, origin, wealth or poverty.

O God, Eternal Father, in Your mercy hear our prayer which we raise up to You amidst the deafening noise and desperation of the world. We turn to You with great hope, full of trust in Your infinite Mercy. Made strong by the examples of the blessed martyrs of Peru, Zbigniew and Michael, who have rendered courageous testimony to the Gospel, to the point of offering their blood, we entrust ourselves to the intercession of Your Most Holy Mother. We ask for the gift of peace and of the elimination from our midst of the sore of terrorism.

Through Christ our Lord. Amen.‚Äù

St. Michael Prayer for Protection

Introduced by Pope Leo XII, the St. Michael Prayer for protection is a popular prayer for both individuals as well as communities‚Äîmany churches have the custom of reciting this prayer at the end of Mass, before the process.

Saint Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle. Be our protection against the wickedness and snares of the devil; May God rebuke him, we humbly pray; And do thou, O Prince of the Heavenly Host, by the power of God, thrust into hell Satan and all evil spirits who wander through the world for the ruin of souls. Amen

Guardian Angel Prayers for Protection

The catechism of the Catholic Church tells us that God ‚Äúbeside each believer stands an angel as protector and shepherd.‚Äù

You can ask for protection through this guardian angel prayer:

O Most holy Angel of God, appointed by God to be my guardian, I give thee thanks for all the benefits which thou hast ever bestowed on me in body and soul. I praise and glorify thee that thou condescended to assist me with such patient fidelity, and to defend me against all the assaults of my enemy. Blessed be the hour in which thou were assigned me for my guardian, my defender and my patron. In acknowledgment and return for all thy loving ministries to me, I offer thee the infinitely precious and noble Heart of Jesus, and firmly purpose to obey thee henceforward, and most faithfully to serve my God. Amen

Prayers for Protection While Driving

The safety of motor vehicles has improved greatly since they first became popular modes of transportation. Still, we can feel dangers on the road, especially for those who drive professionally, take long road trips, or have to travel in adverse conditions.

Some people have the tradition of saying a short prayer for a safe trip before embarking on their drive. Here‚Äôs a simple prayer you can use to pray for protection while driving:

God, please help me arrive safely at my destination today. I pray also for the safety of the other drives I‚Äôll share the road with today. Help me to be patient and attentive. Protect me from any dangerous conditions I may encounter. You‚Äôre a God of protection, who guided and kept safe the journeys of Abraham and Sarah, and Mary and Joseph. Protect me on my drive today.

St. Christopher, patron saint of travelers, pray for me!

Bible Verses for Protection

Hallow has a list of Bible verses for protection. There is no shortage of them!

Perhaps the most popular is Psalm 121: 7-8:

‚ÄúThe LORD will keep you from all harm‚Äîhe will watch over your life; the LORD will watch over your coming and going both now and forevermore.‚Äù 

Psalm 91 is another popular Bible verse with the theme of protection: 

Say to the Lord, ‚ÄúMy refuge and fortress, my God in whom I trust.‚Äù He will rescue you from the fowler‚Äôs snare, from the destroying plague, He will shelter you with his pinions, and under his wings you may take refuge; his faithfulness is a protecting shield. You shall not fear the terror of the night nor the arrow that flies by day, Nor the pestilence that roams in darkness, nor the plague that ravages at noon. Though a thousand fall at your side, ten thousand at your right hand, near you it shall not come. Psalm 91: 2-7

Praying for Protection in Your Own Way

If none of these prayers resonates with you, remember that you can always speak (and listen) to God in your own words.

There‚Äôs no ‚Äúright‚Äù way to ask God for protection. The words that come from your heart work completely fine.

History and Background of Corpus Christi 

After Christ‚Äôs Resurrection on Easter, the Descent of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost, and the celebration of God in Three Persons on Trinity Sunday, we celebrate this solemnity of Jesus among us in the Eucharist. 

Pope Urban IV instituted Corpus Christi in 1264 by the papal bull Transiturus de hoc mundo after it was first introduced in Li√®ge, France, by Bishop Robert Torote. Though it was the incredible eucharistic visions of St. Juliana de Cornillon, also known as St Juliana of Li√®ge, that inspired this solemnity:

When Juliana was 16 she had her first vision which recurred subsequently several times during her Eucharistic adoration. Her vision presented the moon in its full splendour, crossed diametrically by a dark stripe. The Lord made her understand the meaning of what had appeared to her. The moon symbolized the life of the Church on earth, the opaque line, on the other hand, represented the absence of a liturgical feast for whose institution Juliana was asked to plead effectively: namely, a feast in which believers would be able to adore the Eucharist so as to increase in faith, to advance in the practice of the virtues and to make reparation for offences to the Most Holy Sacrament. Pope Benedict XVI, November 17 2010 General Audience

St. Juliana kept this revelation as a joyful secret for 20 years, eventually sharing it with two other women religious and a priest after becoming a prioress. A later Archdeacon in Li√®ges, Jacques Pantal√©on of Troyes, ‚Äúwas won over to the good cause of the Feast of Corpus Christi during his ministry.‚Äù Jacques would later be known as Pope Urban IV. 

With the institution of the Solemnity of Corpus Christ in 1264, Pope Urban IV commissioned church doctor St. Thomas Aquinas to compose the texts for the Liturgical Office of Corpus Christi. The texts include the Sacris Solemnis, Panis Angelicus, Adoro Te Devote, Pange Lingua, and O Salutaris. Reflecting on the text, Pope Benedict XVI said, 

‚ÄúThey are masterpieces, still in use in the Church today, in which theology and 3 poetry are fuse. These texts pluck at the heartstrings in an expression of praise and gratitude to the Most Holy Sacrament, while the mind, penetrating the mystery with wonder, recognizes in the Eucharist the Living and Real Presence of Jesus, of his Sacrifice of love that reconciles us with the Father, and gives us salvation.‚Äù 

On Hallow, pray with these same texts by St. Thomas Aquinas reimagined, arranged, and recorded exclusively by Matt Maher for Hallow. Blending the original Latin lyrics with English translations, this contemporary album, Adoration, Vol. 1, is truly so beautiful for prayer and worship.

Meaning of Corpus Christi

At the heart of this solemnity is the celebration of Christ‚Äôs constant presence here on earth, fully alive in the Eucharist. On Corpus Christ in 2022, Pope Francis reflected on the discreet yet powerful nature of the Eucharist accounted in the Gospels:

The miracle of the loaves and fish does not happen in a spectacular way, but almost discreetly, like the wedding at Cana ‚Äî the bread increases as it passes from hand to hand. And as the crowd eats, they realize that Jesus is taking care of everything. This is the Lord present in the Eucharist. He calls us to be citizens of Heaven, but at the same time, he takes into account the journey we have to face here on earth. If I have hardly any bread in my sack, he knows and takes care of it himself. Pope Francis

This is the true meaning of the Eucharist ‚Äì that He is here, with us. As St. Th√©r√®se of Lisieux once wrote in a letter to a friend, ‚ÄúOh, my darling, think, then, that Jesus is there in the Tabernacle expressly for you, for you alone.‚Äù

Lectio Divina: Gospel Reading ‚Äì June 2, 2025

On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread,when they sacrificed the Passover lamb,Jesus‚Äô disciples said to him,‚ÄúWhere do you want us to goand prepare for you to eat the Passover?‚ÄùHe sent two of his disciples and said to them,‚ÄúGo into the city and a man will meet you,carrying a jar of water.Follow him.Wherever he enters, say to the master of the house,‚ÄòThe Teacher says, ‚ÄúWhere is my guest roomwhere I may eat the Passover with my disciples?‚Äù‚ÄòThen he will show you a large upper room furnished and ready.Make the preparations for us there.‚ÄùThe disciples then went off, entered the city,and found it just as he had told them;and they prepared the Passover.

While they were eating,he took bread, said the blessing,broke it, gave it to them, and said,‚ÄúTake it; this is my body.‚ÄùThen he took a cup, gave thanks, and gave it to them,and they all drank from it.He said to them,‚ÄúThis is my blood of the covenant,which will be shed for many.Amen, I say to you,I shall not drink again the fruit of the vineuntil the day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.‚ÄùThen, after singing a hymn,they went out to the Mount of Olives.

Is there a particular phrase, word, or image that stands out to you in this reading? What does it mean for us that Jesus is the ‚ÄúLiving Bread‚Äù? 

Meditate: I Am Here Meditations 

Hallow and the Archdiocese of Detroit partnered to launch the I Am Here campaign to support the National Eucharistic Revival in the U.S. Catholic Church in 2022. Find the beautiful and affirming ‚ÄúI Am‚Äù meditations for Eucharistic Adoration on Hallow, featuring prayers for seeking God amidst loneliness, heartache, anger, tiredness, and prayers leading you to peace, patience, and trust in Jesus. The I Am meditations are led by Julianne Stanz and Bishop Andrew Cozzens. The following is a beautiful meditation on the first I Am meditation, ‚ÄúI Am God:‚Äù

Be Still and Know. Stillness of heart and mind prepares us for conversations with God. When we are present and still, the Sacred Scriptures tell us that we will have knowledge or wisdom of God. Often we are so busy in our conversations preparing to respond that we forget to be still and be present to what is spoken and what is unspoken. Many people today do not feel truly listened to. When we are listened to, we are not understood. We feel that nobody really knows who we are or nobody cares enough to listen to us. But God knows you more than anyone else. He is listening. He is here. Meditation 1: Begin Here, with Julianne Stanz

Spiritual Warfare and the Church

Exorcisms

Saints to Ask for Help From

Spiritual warfare recognizes that the devil is real, evil exists, and each day, these forces attempt to drive us towards living lives of sin.

It exists both in the dramatic moments but also in the mundane, daily experience of every day life, according to Fr. Dwight Longenecker.

‚ÄúOur basic default setting for the Christian life is spiritual warfare,‚Äù he told the National Catholic Register. ‚ÄúWe have to understand that we‚Äôre confronted with spiritual warfare every day in multiple ways‚Ä¶.It‚Äôs in the perseverance of faith that the real spiritual warfare takes place.‚Äù

Spiritual Warfare: Biblical Origins 

The New Testament gives us plenty of examples of Jesus casting out demons and, later, commissioning the disciples to do the same (Luke 9:1). 

There are smaller spiritual battles that we face each day.

In the first letter of Peter, we‚Äôre reminded that all humans undergo these challenges, which seek to divide us from God:

Be sober and vigilant. Your opponent the devil is prowling around like a roaring lion looking for [someone] to devour. 9 Resist him, steadfast in faith, knowing that your fellow believers throughout the world undergo the same sufferings. (1 Peter 5:8-9)

While the BIble references spiritual warfare, it also gives us examples of how to battle it.

Paul‚Äôs letter to the Ephesians is a famous example of this:

Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil‚Äôs schemes. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand. Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. (Ephesians 6:10-20)

And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the Lord‚Äôs people. Pray also for me, that whenever I speak, words may be given me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel, for which I am an ambassador in chains. Pray that I may declare it fearlessly, as I should.

In ‚ÄúTalking Back: A Monastic Handbook for Combating Demons,‚Äù Evagrius of Pontus, a 4th-century monk, collected 498 passages from the Bible and provided instruction on how they could be used to ‚Äútalk back‚Äù to demons amid spiritual warfare.

Spending time with Scripture helps us stay close to God and avoid the temptation of sin.

7 Deadly Sins and Virtues

Sin turns our hearts away from God‚Äôs love for us. If we turn away from God and His law, we turn closer to the devil.

The ‚ÄúSeven Deadly Sins‚Äù as we know them were articulated by Pope Gregory the Great in the sixth century:

Anger

Greed

Lust

Pride

Gluttony

Sloth

Envy

He identified one sin as the root or gateway to others:

‚ÄúFor when pride, the queen of sins, has fully possessed a conquered heart, she surrenders it immediately to seven principal sins, as if to some of her generals, to lay it waste,‚Äù he wrote.

Conversely, there are seven corresponding virtues that help us make good moral choices and draw closer to God:

Charity

Chastity

Diligence

Humility

Kindness

Patience

Temperance

When we avoid these sins and opt for their corresponding virtue, we strengthen our resolve in spiritual battle against the snares of the devil.

Spiritual Warfare and the Church

Spiritual warfare has a long history, but it‚Äôs not limited to history: It exists today, as the Church is acutely aware.

The Catechism of the Catholic Church makes reference to the ‚Äúspiritual battle‚Äù that we all fight, and how prayer is key in this battle.

‚ÄúPrayer is both a gift of grace and a determined response on our part. It always presupposes effort. the great figures of prayer of the Old Covenant before Christ, as well as the Mother of God, the saints, and he himself, all teach us this: prayer is a battle. Against whom? Against ourselves and against the wiles of the tempter who does all he can to turn man away from prayer, away from union with God. We pray as we live, because we live as we pray. If we do not want to act habitually according to the Spirit of Christ, neither can we pray habitually in his name. the ‚Äúspiritual battle‚Äù of the Christian‚Äôs new life is inseparable from.‚Äù (CCC 2775)

In a 2014 meditation, Pope Francis reminded us that ‚Äúthe Devil exists and we have to fight against him.‚Äù

In 2021, Pope Francis reminded us of the power of the Holy Spirit to nourish us, guide us, and protect us in spiritual battle:

‚ÄúThus, the life of the community is regenerated in the Holy Spirit; and it is always thanks to him that we nourish our Christian lives and continue to engage in our spiritual battle.‚Äù

But some instances of spiritual warfare are more severe than others. And the Church has guidelines for those, too.

Spiritual Warfare and Exorcisms

Popular 1973 horror movie ‚ÄúThe Exorcist‚Äù introduced many to the concept of demonic possession and exorcism.

Although Hollywood movies and television shows often exaggerate, dramatize, or misrepresent many aspects of faith, including exorcisms, they are indeed a reality of our world. 

The USCCB teaches us that there are two forms of exorcisms: minor and major. Minor exorcisms take place before Baptism and RCIA. The Rite of Baptism includes a ‚ÄúPrayer of Exorcism‚Äù that the celebrant prays:

Almighty and ever-living God, you sent your only Son into the world to cast out the power of Satan, spirit of evil, to rescue man from the kingdom of darkness, and bring him into the splendor of your kingdom of light. We pray for this child: set him (her) free from original sin, make him (her) a temple of your glory, and send your Holy Spirit to dwell with him (her). We ask this through Christ our Lord.

Major exorcisms, like those seen in the movie The Exorcist, are different. Only bishops or priests with special permissions can perform major exorcisms, which are directed toward ‚Äúthe expulsion of demons or to the liberation [of a person] from demonic possession.‚Äù

According to Fr. Vincent Lampert, who leads Hallow‚Äôs course on spiritual warfare, there are four main criteria that the Church uses to establish a valid case of demonic possession in an individual:

the ability to speak and understand languages otherwise unknown to the individual,

exhibiting extraordinary strength (beyond the normal ability of the individual),

elevated perception with knowledge beyond natural power,  that is, information otherwise unknown to the individual, and finally,

strong resistance against all divine influences i.e. the Bible, sacred places, crucifix, holy water, relics, etc.  

Today, the Pope Leo XIII Institute assists bishops, priests, and deacons in supporting those dealing with this serious condition. It also works with laity to create prayer teams who support exorcisms by praying for those afflicted.

Indeed, prayer is the most simple form of protection amid spiritual warfare that we have available to us. When we pray, we can ask for angels and saints to intercede for us.

Saints: Intercessors for Spiritual Warfare

The communion of saints offers many holy men and women who are able and willing to pray for us as we battle spiritual warfare.

St. Michael the Archangel is one saint that many people turn to when seeking protection. In fact, many churches conclude Mass by praying the St. Michael prayer. You can also pray the St. Michael Chaplet.

Since he protected the Blessed Virgin Mary, St. Joseph is also a popular saint for intercession against spiritual warfare.

Many people also ask for the intercession of St. Padre Pio. In his letters, he wrote often about being mindful of spiritual battles we face:

Drive away what the enemy is whispering loudly in your when he wants you to believe you are almost on the point of being lost. Despite these evil insinuations, the Lord is with you as never before in your tribulations. God tells us. Take heart, then, and don‚Äôt be afraid, for it is quite certain that the one who fears to be lost will not be lost and the one who fights with his eyes fixed on God will cry victory and the triumphal hymn. There is nothing to be afraid, for the heavenly Father has promised us the necessary help to prevent us from being overcome by temptations.

More Prayer Resources

When we stay close to God in prayer, and fill our hearts and minds with desires to do His will, we make it harder for the devil to find a space to tempt us or lead us astray. 

Consider praying the rosary or committing to pray a novena, such as the Mary, Undoer of Knots novena. You can also deepen your trust and reliance on God by praying the Litany of Trust.

Finally, Hallow‚Äôs course on spiritual warfare, led by Fr. Vincent Lampert, is available in the Hallow app.

St. Gertrude Prayer, Chaplet and Rosary: How to Pray

St. Gertrude, also known as St. Gertrude the Great, was a 13th-century German nun of the Benedictine order who belonged to the famous Monastery of Helfsta.

Few details of Gertrude‚Äôs early life are known, but we know a tremendous amount about her adult life and her interior life through her writings.

In ‚ÄúThe Herald of God‚Äôs Loving Kindness,‚Äù we learn that Gertrude had either three or four brothers and sisters and pursued a religious vocation, to which she originally was indifferent after her parents chose that path for her.

At 25, she began to experience visions of Jesus, which set her heart ablaze in a new way and led her to become one of the most well-known mystics in Church history. 

An introduction to ‚ÄúThe Life and Revelations of St. Gertrude,‚Äù attributed to an anonymous member of the Convent of Poor Clares, describes Gertrude and her love of Christ in beautiful imagery.

‚ÄúA loving heart will always be a thankful heart; and so the continual incense of thanksgiving which ascended from the heart of Gertrude before the Eternal Throne, was but the fragrant aroma of the love which burned daily deeper and brighter within her.‚Äù

St. Gertrude‚Äôs Visions 

St. Gertrude‚Äôs visions of Jesus ultimately led to her popular prayer, as well as the St. Gertrude Chaplet (‚ÄúSt. Gertrude Rosary‚Äù), a faith practice that remains popular even today, nearly 800 years since her death. 

One of her visions, recounted in ‚ÄúThe Life and Revelations of St. Gertrude,‚Äù saw an encounter with Jesus that made clear the power of praying for others. It beautifully visualizes prayer and its connection to the Sacred Heart of Jesus (to which St. Gertrude was an early devotee):.

But my God, wilt Thou not hear my prayer for my friends?‚Äù Then our Lord confirmed His words as with an oath, replying: ‚ÄúI will, by My Divine power.‚Äù The Saint replied: ‚ÄúHear, then, my petition for the person so often recommended to my prayers.‚Äù

And immediately she beheld a stream, pure as crystal, flowing forth from the Heart of the Lord into the person for whom she prayed. 

Gertrude‚Äôs visionary encounters with Christ led her to abandon forms of vanity and devote herself more fully to God and in a special way, the study of Scripture.

She ‚Äúdevoted herself to writing and popularizing the truth of faith with clarity and simplicity, with grace and persuasion, serving the Church faithfully and lovingly so as to be helpful to and appreciated by theologians and devout people,‚Äù said Pope Benedict XVI.

St. Gertrude developed a special fondness and devotion to praying for souls in purgatory, as detailed in ‚ÄúThe Herald of Divine Love‚Äù:

As for her, she besought the Lord that all those in heaven and on earth and even in purgatory (for indeed, all would have benefited from the fruits of her works, had she not been negligent) might now have at least some share in those fruits with which she had just been enriched by his divine generosity. As she was praying, each single one of her good works (symbolized by the fruits of the tree) began to distill a beneficent liquid. Part of this liquid spread over the blessed, increasing their bliss; part of it spread out over purgatory, easing the pain of souls; another part of it spread over the earth, increasing the sweetness of grace for the just, and for sinners the bitterness of repentance. 

Pope Benedict XVI also tells us that ‚ÄúSt Gertrude‚Äôs life lives on as a lesson of Christian life, of an upright path, and shows us that the heart of a happy life, of a true life, is friendship with the Lord Jesus.‚Äù

Much of that lesson comes in the form of her prayer and devotion to souls in purgatory.

St. Gertrude Prayer

According to 1911 book ‚ÄúLove, Peace, and Joy: A month of the Sacred Heart According to St. Gertrude‚Äù, perhaps the simplest prayer associated with St. Gertrude is just three words: ‚ÄúFiat voluntas tua‚Äù, Latin for ‚ÄúMay Thy will be done.‚Äù 

In one of her visions, St. Gertrude received the following prayer, now commonly called the St. Gertrude prayer or the prayer of St. Gertrude, from Jesus:

Eternal Father, I offer thee the Most Precious Blood of Thy Divine Son, Jesus in union with all the Masses said throughout the world today, for all the Holy Souls in Purgatory, for sinners everywhere, for sinners in the universal church, those in my own home and within my own family. Amen.

This prayer for souls in purgatory is prominent in the St. Gertrude Rosary. It also forms the basis for the St. Gertrude novena, where this prayer is repeated each day for nine days.

The St. Gertrude prayer for souls in purgatory is also the main component of the St. Gertrude Chaplet.

How to Pray the St. Gertrude Chaplet

A chaplet is a special personal, devotional prayer. It often uses rosary beads or a single strand (or decade) of beads. Chaplets often involve repeating a particular prayer, as well as introductory and concluding prayers.

The St. Gertrude Chaplet is sometimes called the ‚ÄúSt. Gertrude Rosary‚Äù because it‚Äôs prayed using standard rosary beads.

Because chaplets are personal devotions, feel free to try your own version based on the St. Gertrude prayer. If you‚Äôre more comfortable following along a more established version, here‚Äôs how to pray a popular version of the St. Gertrude chaplet:

Make the sign of the cross. Beginning at the crucifix, recite the Apostles Creed

Facebook

Twitter

Pinterest

At the first large bead, Pray the Our Father

Over the next three small beads, Pray three Hail Marys

On the next large bead, pray a Glory Be

Facebook

Twitter

Pinterest

On the medallion or medal of the Rosary, pray the Our Father

Next, on the first decade of the Rosary beads, pray the St. Gertrude prayer

Eternal Father, I offer thee the Most Precious Blood of Thy Divine Son, Jesus in union with all the Masses said throughout the world today, for all the Holy Souls in Purgatory, for sinners everywhere, for sinners in the universal church, those in my own home and within my own family. Amen.

Repeat this nine times, and then pray two special prayers common in the St. Gertrude chaplet:

Most Sacred Heart of Jesus, open the hearts and minds of sinners to the truth and light of God, the Father. 

Immaculate Heart of Mary, pray for the conversion of sinners in the world.

Pray a Glory Be, then pray an Our Father on the large bead and repeat for the next four decades.

Repeat this for the next four decades

Close with the sign of the cross.

Though no official Church teaching suggests this, traditional belief holds that each time the St. Gertrude prayer is prayed, 1,000 souls are released from purgatory. Therefore, each time the St. Gertrude rosary is prayed, 50,000 souls enter heaven from purgatory.

St. Michael‚Äôs Lent: How to Pray and Observe St. Michael‚Äôs Lent

St. Michael‚Äôs Lent is a spiritual practice rich in history and meaning, dating back to the 13th century. Saint Francis of Assisi, one of the Catholic Church‚Äôs most beloved saints, received the stigmata on the feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross (September 14) and began this devotion in honor of Our Lady and Saint Michael the Archangel.

Origin and meaning

We learn about the the tradition of St. Michael‚Äôs Lent as described in ‚ÄúThe Little Flowers of St. Francis‚Äù by St. Bonaventure. Similar to Lent before Easter, St. Michael‚Äôs Lent is a 40-day period of prayer and penance that begins on the Solemnity of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary (August 15) and ends on the feast of the Holy Archangels: St. Michael, St. Gabriel and St. Raphael (September 29). This time of devotion is an opportunity for the faithful to renew their faith and grow in union with God.

The devotion of St. Francis of Assisi

St. Francis had a great devotion to St. Michael the Archangel. He lived this 40-day period with deep reverence and a spirit of penance. According to St. Bonaventure:

‚ÄúTwo years before his death, having begun a Lenten retreat in honor of Saint Michael on a very high mountain called Alverne, [Francisco] felt more abundantly than ever the softness of heavenly contemplation, the ardor of supernatural desires and the profusion of divine graces.‚Äù

St. Michael‚Äôs Lent has been kept alive by the Franciscans over the centuries, making it popular with lay people as well as religious. Despite not being part of the Church‚Äôs official liturgical calendar, this devotion is a rich opportunity to immerse oneself in prayer and penance, as St. Francis did, in order to draw even closer to the Lord.

Spiritual Practices

Ways to observe St. Michael‚Äôs Lent include:

Daily Prayer: Pray the Litany of St. Michael or other prayers dedicated to him.

Penance: Choosing some kind of fast or choose something to give up to offer to God, such as waking up at dawn or abstaining from a specific food.

Charity: Find a way to demonstrate love to those most in need in a concrete way, such as through the corporal works of mercy.

Confession and Mass: Celebrate the Sacrament of Reconciliation and Holy Mass regularly in order to be open to God‚Äôs graces.

Our Lady of the Assumption, pray for us! St. Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle!

Pray during St. Michael‚Äôs Lent on Hallow now!

St. Peregrine Novena: How to Pray

Stephen Spiewak

Facebook

Twitter

Pinterest

Although his life sounds almost too unbelievable to be true, St. Peregrine not only existed but also left behind an incredible legacy that sees him still to this day as a patron saint to so many people battling terrible illnesses.

St. Peregrine Laziosi, now known as ‚ÄúThe Cancer Saint,‚Äù was born in Forli, Italy in 1265.

According to ‚ÄúThe Fairest Flower of Paradise: Considerations on the Litany of the Blessed Virgin, Enriched with Examples Drawn from the Lives of the Saints‚Äù by Rev. Alexis M. Lepicier, O.S.M., Laziosi grew up ‚Äúa fierce enemy of the Church and the Pope,‚Äù helping to lead revolutions against Church authority.

In a major act of rebellion, Peregrine famously slapped St. Philip Benizi. St. Philip forgave him and prayed for him. Peregrine ‚Äúwas changed into another man‚Äù by the display of forgiveness, which eventually led to Peregrine joining the Servite order of friars.

As part of his self-imposed penance, Peregrine committed to never sitting unless absolutely necessary. He often slept leaning against a rock or a church bench. He tirelessly preached the Gospel and served the sick and the poor. Eventually, at 60, Peregrine‚Äôs legs began to fail him, as one leg developed cancer, marked by a horrible lesion. 

The stench of the infected lesion made it unpleasant for others to be around Peregrine.

The night before his cancerous leg was set to be amputated, Peregrine prayed before an image of Jesus on the Cross. According to the Friends of St. Peregrine, Peregrine‚Äôs prayer ‚Äúled him into a deep trance-like sleep during which he envisioned the crucified Christ leaving the cross and touching his cancerous leg.‚Äù

He awoke the next day and his leg was completely healed, free of cancer and with no visible signs of sickness. 

St. Peregrine is perhaps the only saint whose medical miracle is documented on the National Institute of Health (NIH) site, saying ‚ÄúHis physician was astonished to observe that there were no signs of the tumour.‚Äù

Praying for the Intercession of Saint Peregrine

Throughout the rest of his life, and after his death, many miracles were attributed to St. Peregrine, including restoring sight to the blind, casting out evil spirits, and healing abdominal injuries. He became known as ‚ÄúGlorious Wonder Worker‚Äù for the many miracles he was associated with.

The Friends of St. Peregrine feature many modern miraculous healings that, while not miracles officially recognized by the Church, are attributed to St. Peregrine by those who experienced them. One such example comes from Michaelynn in December 2019:

My brother was diagnosed with leukemia in June 2019. I googled the patron saint of anyone suffering from this disease and found St. Peregrine.  I immediately began a novena for his intercession.  I also asked everyone I knew to pray for my brother as well.  My brother was immediately placed on chemotherapy. His response was so quick that he was released from the hospital earlier than expected.   I continued to pray. My brother called me in August to tell me that he was leukemia free. I remembered the story in the Bible of Jesus healing a group of men and only one returned to thank Him. I am thanking Our Lord for my brother‚Äôs healing and St. Peregrine for his intercession.

We can always turn to God in our moments of suffering.

In an address to the sick at the National Cancer Institute, Pope John Paul XIII said of God: ‚ÄúHe will always dry your tears, if you are able to look at his Cross and anticipate in hope the reward for this suffering. Trust in him. He will not abandon you!‚Äù

We can pray to God, through the intercession of St. Peregrine, the patron saint of those battling cancer, cancerous diseases, HIV/AIDS and other incurab.

St. Peregrine, patron of those battling cancer and other disease, you devoted your life entirely to God, tirelessly tending to God‚Äôs children battling sickness and poverty and constantly preaching His word. I beseech thee, o mighty St. Peregrine, to pray for me, that God may heal and protect me from any affliction, should it be His will, and that I may trust entirely in Him, as you modeled so courageously.

St. Peregrine, I ask you to join me today in praying for scientists and researchers who seek to put an end to cancer as well as create more effective ways to treat this terrible disease. Through your intercession, may God bless with wisdom, knowledge, and strength those who have devoted their lives to seeking an end to cancer so that we may soon have a cure. I also ask for you to pray for this special intention of mine: (state your intention).

St. Peregrine, to whom many miracles are attributed, pray that God may grant this request. Pray also that despite the suffering I face, I can surrender myself to God‚Äôs will.

One Hail Mary..

One Our Father‚Ä¶

One Glory Be‚Ä¶

Amen. 

Day 8 ‚Äì For those near the end of their battle with cancer

The 9 Books That Helped Make Me a Christian

Alex Jones

Facebook

Twitter

Pinterest

I have written in a few of our posts about the power of a collection of great books and the impact that they have had throughout my faith journey.

I‚Äôve broken these 9 books across 3 phases of my faith journey so far: discovering my faith, diving deeper, and learning to live it out. I am very much still in the midst of each of these steps, so if you have any recommendations please send them my way by commenting below or emailing me at alex@hallow.com.

Discovery

1.Doing The Truth In Love by Michael J. Himes. This book was recommended to me by one of the most intelligent Christians I know as a simple, yet thoughtful way to understand what it is that Christianity really believes. It‚Äôs short, sweet, and a phenomenal intro to the theology of Christianity.  It really helped me to discover that the Christian God was not some old man sitting up in the sky judging all of us, but that at His core is Love.

‚ÄúWhat the Christian tradition maintains is the least inadequate expression for God finds its clearest, sharpest, simplest statement in one of the last-written documents of the collection of the early Christian documents which we call the New Testament, the first letter of John. There we read that ‚ÄúGod is love‚Äù (1 Jn 4:8 and 16). But the love which is offered as the least wrong way to think and speak about God is of a very peculiar sort: agape. Agape is a Greek word meaning love which is purely other directed, love which seeks no return, love which does not want anything back. Perhaps so as not to confuse it with the many other meanings which we attach to the word ‚Äúlove‚Äù in English, we might translate agape as ‚Äúpure self-gift‚Äù

2. The second book is by one of my favorite authors of all time: C.S. Lewis.  He argues with beautiful logic and clarity for what we all believe in as Christians.  He has many books (even two more on this list), but the one I started with was Mere Christianity.  I credit this book with helping to re-introduce me to Jesus.

‚ÄúI am trying here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish thing that people often say about Him: I‚Äôm ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don‚Äôt accept his claim to be God. That is the one thing we must not say. A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic ‚Äî on the level with the man who says he is a poached egg ‚Äî or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or something worse. You can shut him up for a fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God, but let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to.‚Äù 

3. The last on my list of discovery is the book The Everlasting Man by G.K. Chesterton. He does a great job of deciphering between different religious belief systems and helping us to understand the relationship between science and Christianity.

‚ÄúNobody can imagine how nothing could turn into something. Nobody can get an inch nearer to it by explaining how something could turn into something else. It is really far more logical to start by saying ‚ÄòIn the beginning God created heaven and earth‚Äô even if you only mean ‚ÄòIn the beginning some unthinkable power began some unthinkable process.‚Äô For God is by its nature a name of mystery, and nobody ever supposed that man could imagine how a world was created any more than he could create one. But evolution really is mistaken for explanation. It has the fatal quality of leaving on many minds the impression that they do understand it and everything else.‚Äù 

Diving deeper

4. Now as we dig deeper we‚Äôll move to one of the classics: Dostoevsky‚ÄôsThe Brothers Karamazov. This is beautiful novel about family, spirituality and about God. It‚Äôs dense, full of meaning, and to be honest with you, I‚Äôm not sure I even understand half of what he is trying to say. I‚Äôll just keep re-reading it till I do.

‚ÄúBe not forgetful of prayer. Every time you pray, if your prayer is sincere, there will be new feeling and new meaning in it, which will give you fresh courage, and you will understand that prayer is an education.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThere is only one way to salvation, and that is to make yourself responsible for all men‚Äôs sins. As soon as you make yourself responsible in all sincerity for everything and for everyone, you will see at once that this is really so, and that you are in fact to blame for everyone and for all things.

5. Another fantastic book is Francis Chan‚Äôs Crazy Love.  It does a phenomenal job of re-introducing us to the radicalness of the Christian faith and dares us to live as our Christian faith calls us to.

‚ÄúSomething is wrong when our lives make sense to unbelievers.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen it‚Äôs hard and you are doubtful, give more.‚Äù 

6. Time to add another C.S. Lewis to the list! The Great Divorce is a beautifully written visualization of heaven and hell.

‚ÄúThere are only two kinds of people in the end: those who say to God, ‚ÄúThy will be done,‚Äù and those to whom God says, in the end, ‚ÄúThy will be done.‚Äù All that are in Hell, choose it. Without that self-choice there could be no Hell. No soul that seriously and constantly desires joy will ever miss it. Those who seek find. Those who knock it is opened.‚Äù 

Learning to live it out

7. Have you had enough of C.S. Lewis yet?  Too bad! This is one of the more difficult books I‚Äôve ever read. Screwtape Letters is written from the perspective of a demon who is actively trying to win over a man‚Äôs soul.  Before reading this book, I probably would have described myself as a pretty good guy. Needless to say, after reading this book and Lewis‚Äô perfect articulations of our day to day sins, my perspective of myself quickly changed.

‚ÄúIt does not matter how small the sins are provided that their cumulative effect is to edge the man away from the Light and out into the Nothing. Murder is no better than cards if cards can do the trick. Indeed the safest road to Hell is the gradual one‚Äìthe gentle slope, soft underfoot, without sudden turnings, without milestones, without signposts.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhen He [God] talks of their losing their-selves, He means only abandoning the clamour of self-will; once they have done that, He really gives them back all their personality, and boasts (I am afraid, sincerely) that when they are wholly His they will be more themselves than ever.‚Äù 

8. And now arguably my favorite book on this list (except for the last): Fr. Gregory Boyle‚Äôs Tattoos On The Heart  This is the best example of how to live out Catholic Social Teaching that I‚Äôve ever read. I honestly cried at every chapter of this book.

‚ÄúHere is what we seek: a compassion that can stand in awe at what the poor have to carry rather than stand in judgment at how they carry it.‚Äù 

‚ÄúIf there is a fundamental challenge within these stories, it is simply to change our lurking suspicion that some lives matter less than other lives.‚Äù 

‚ÄúSuccess and failure, ultimately, have little to do with living the gospel. Jesus just stood with the outcasts until they were welcomed or until he was crucified ‚Äî whichever came first.‚Äù 

9. Lastly, the Bible. I couldn‚Äôt in good conscious put it on a list with any other book.  Those books are great, but they are all written by people talking about God. The Bible is something different. After re-discovering my faith, I began to make my way through the New Testament (am now still working through the Old), and it changed my life.  I felt power and meaning in words that I was only beginning to understand. It began a conversation with God that I know will continue for the rest of my life.  

One of my favorite ways to engage with Scripture is through the ancient prayer method Lectio Divina, a beautiful way of reading scripture slowly and meditatively, letting God speak to you directly through the words. It is one of my favorite prayer methods in Hallow‚Äôs guided meditation and prayer app. There are no quotes that would do this justice, but because I couldn‚Äôt resist I pulled a few from Hallow‚Äôs first introductory Lectio Divina sessions:

‚ÄúCome to me all you that are weary and are carrying heavy burdens, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.‚Äù (Matthew 11:28-30)

‚ÄòA great gale arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so that the boat was already being swamped. But [Jesus] was in the stern, asleep on the cushion; and they woke him up and said to him, ‚ÄòTeacher, do you not care that we are perishing?‚Äô He woke up and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, ‚ÄòPeace! Be still!‚Äô Then the wind ceased, and there was a dead calm.  [Jesus] said to them, ‚ÄòWhy are you afraid?‚Äô‚Äô (Mark 4:37-40)

‚ÄòYou are the light of the world. A city built on a hill cannot be hid. No one after lighting a lamp puts it under the bushel basket, but on the lampstand, and it gives light to all in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father in heaven.‚Äô (Matthew 5:14-16)

As I said at the beginning: I am still very much at the start of this journey and would love to hear your comments and any book recommendations you have ‚Äì please comment below!

The Hallow Story

My story is not unique in today‚Äôs world. I was raised Catholic through high school. I was baptized, confirmed, and went to Mass pretty much every Sunday, but I never really believed in it all. I was largely just going through the motions.  

As you might expect, I quickly fell away from my faith. Up through the end of college I would have called myself agnostic, though in retrospect I was atheist. I thought: with everything we know in the 21st century, who could believe anymore in a God that sat up in the clouds and cared about whether we were nice or not? Weren‚Äôt all of these religions just different myths created to explain what science had yet to discover? Weren‚Äôt they all just legends to help us cope with death?  I was not the kind of person to fall prey to the kind of naive thinking. I was the kind of person who believed what was supported by fact and evidence, by logic and reason.

It was a relatively dark and empty time in my life. There was nothing terribly depressing or evil, I just carried a vague feeling of emptiness and anxiety. I found myself being mean to people I loved, caught in feelings of jealousy, anxiety, lust, and insecurity. I struggled to have any real motivation or purpose.   

Then things began to change. I started to meet friends who had rational arguments for their faith, friends who didn‚Äôt just believe in someone up in the sky, but who had a philosophy and theology based on logic and reason and experience that guided their lives. I started to read, not books of advanced theology, but simple books trying to articulate the Christian faith at its core. Aspects from these discussions and books resonated within me: arguments about free will, about faith, about love. I started to think that maybe this whole Christianity thing wasn‚Äôt all just a fairy-tale after all.  

But something still didn‚Äôt click with me. Apparently, you‚Äôre supposed to be able to talk to this God. You‚Äôre supposed to be able to be friends with Him. And that‚Äôs something I had never experienced and, honestly, wasn‚Äôt sure I could. I tried praying, but for me, my only exposure to prayer were the ones I memorized as a child. I had never explored any new ways to pray, and though I knew that these memorized prayers were supposed to be deep and powerful, I just could not get past the feeling that I was talking to a wall.

It was then that I entered the professional world ‚Äì a world full of emails, reviews, deadlines, stress and busyness. A world with very little silence or time to pause.

I kept trying to grow in my faith, but I felt like I was stagnating, so I decided to try mindfulness meditation. The only type of meditation I was aware of was from eastern traditions, and so I tried some of the popular guided apps.

I loved them. They were a great way to learn mindfulness meditation without needing to travel across the world.  For the first time I found what felt like a sense of peace and calm. The only issue was that it felt like I was trying to force-fit my Christian faith into an agnostic or Buddhist box. I had no idea whether this was in line with what the Church taught, or if I was somehow going against my faith by practicing these methods of meditation. Plus, I could not get over the feeling that I was focusing too much on myself during these sessions. I kept feeling the pull of my mind to focus outward, to focus on my faith and on others.

And that‚Äôs when I really started to think that there‚Äôs got to be something more.  There‚Äôs got to be a way to build a deep and living relationship with God within the Christian context. After all, there are monks who spend their entire lives in seclusion, religious brothers and sisters who describe their life and work as ‚Äúprayer without ceasing.‚Äù There are people my age who are choosing to dedicate themselves entirely to God alone.

St. Thomas Aquinas, one of the greatest writers in Christian history, received a revelation from God so powerful that he left his culminating five-volume work unfinished simply saying: ‚ÄúAll that I have written appears to be as so much straw after the things that have been revealed to me.‚Äù

And I began to think, what if this kind of relationship is possible for me? What if there really is a God out there that cared about what I did with my life? Someone who is constantly trying to communicate with me? What if I could wake up each morning and instead of trying to figure out what I wanted to do, ask God what He wanted me to do? What if I could somehow start to hear Him, to recognize what He‚Äôs saying?

What if I could spend the entire day in conversation with God? Constantly growing with Him, exploring and understanding my faith, and actually be excited to go to church?

Constantly with Him. Sharing in His joy and peace. Bringing all of my shortcomings and worries, stresses and relationships to Him. Letting Him carry them for me. Letting Him into my day-to-day mundane routines, into my hopes and dreams. Letting Him guide my purpose in life.  

What if I could somehow find this peace, joy and relationship with God, without having to go off to live in the mountains somewhere?

That‚Äôs the question that started the work we‚Äôve been doing at Hallow.

Our goal is to discover how to find this relationship through our faith, how to share in the peace and joy God brings into the real world, every day.  

We spent the first few months digging in and researching all the different ways to pray and meditate offered in the Christian tradition. We talked to countless priests, religious brothers and sisters, faith leaders from different denominations and lay people inspired by their faith to try and learn the methods to finding and growing in peace with God. And we started testing and trying the different things we were learning in our own prayer lives.  

And what we found was more than we ever could have expected. We found a world deep with history, experience, and teaching going back thousands of years.

A world where seminarians and religious brothers and sisters spend an entire year learning different methods of prayer that I, a supposed Catholic my entire life, had never even heard of.

A world that offered an entire new collection of interesting and deeply spiritual ways to pray.

We couldn‚Äôt wait to continue to learn and share them.

This is the idea behind Hallow: provide a simple, easy-to-use mobile app that helps us foster a relationship with God and the peace of prayer through guided prayer and meditation.

Hallow is a simple way to create a daily, personal retreat each morning for you in your home. The idea isn‚Äôt to invent new ways to pray, but rather to bring to the world the enormously rich pool of contemplative prayer methods that already exist within the Christian faith today.

This is what we‚Äôre building. And so far we‚Äôve been blessed beyond our wildest dreams. By the grace of God, after the first year we became the #1 Catholic App on the App Stores, and have just crossed 10 million prayers completed through the app.

But more importantly, we‚Äôre discovering that it is possible to build this kind of relationship with God in our day-to-day, and that this simple app is able to act as a means for the Holy Spirit to work through.

Here are some of the things people have been saying about it:

‚ÄúI‚Äôve felt closer to God than I ever have before‚Äù

‚ÄúBy far the best app on my phone.‚Äù

‚ÄúHallow has been a miracle in my life and has made returning to the faith so much easier‚Äù

‚ÄúI hate quoting a old, over used cliche, but I‚Äôve been very lost. And I think for the first time in a while I maybe found.‚Äù

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt have decided to follow the Catholic Faith if it wasn‚Äôt for your app and the countless hours using it.‚Äú

‚ÄúA huge gift for Christians of all stripes craving a more meaningful prayer practice.‚Äú

‚ÄúThis app has been an answer for my weary soul. Tears pour as I try to impress on you how deeply i am impacted by the guidance into simply being with God. This is where my soul is finding peace for the very first time.‚Äú

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt rate apps‚Ä¶but this app by far is not only the best prayer app, but it also is the fruit of a whol¬≠ly ded¬≠i¬≠cat¬≠ed team of peo¬≠ple who want to help peo¬≠ple pray. This is a work of pas¬≠sion and it shows. By far the best Chris¬≠t¬≠ian app, and by my es¬≠ti¬≠ma¬≠tion, best app on the App Store.‚Äú

You might say, ‚ÄúWell that all sounds great, but how can I start?  What can I do now?‚Äù

Well, the first thing I‚Äôd say is just to download the app! It will walk you through step by step how to get started and personalize your experience for you. You can find it on the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store. Just type in Hallow, like Hallowed be Thy Name üôÇ But if you‚Äôre interested in reading more about a couple of the initial techniques that we put on the app, read on!

One huge lesson we have learned in our research is that there are many different types of prayer. There are the traditional spoken prayers. There‚Äôs singing, chant, and Taiz√© meditation. There are group prayers and the Liturgy of the Hours. We‚Äôve since added all of these types of prayer to the app! But the types of meditations that make up most of the content on the app can be categorized into Christian Meditation, the Examen, and Lectio Divina.

1. Christian Meditation ‚Äì Finding peace in silence

This type of prayer is simple. With all the busyness, distraction and noise in our lives today it feels like there is no way just to sit and be still. Christian meditation is one way we can.

Essentially, we find a quiet place to sit and try to focus our mind on something holy. This might be a phrase such as ‚ÄúCome, Holy Spirit,‚Äù the Rosary, or an image of God leading you beside a stream.

It‚Äôs a practice that‚Äôs very similar to the mindfulness meditation, but the difference is that we use this simple focus on the breath only to collect ourselves and then turn our minds to God.  The best part of Christian meditation is that we are not the ones doing the work. The goal is to put ourselves in a position to let God takeover, to set our minds on Him and let Him lead us.

So, but how do you actually do it? First, try to find a time and place to pray. It can be anywhere: a floor, a chair, a couch, a bench. It just needs to be a place of calm and quiet where you can consistently return. You can have your legs straight or crossed, your hands clasped together or palms up. Essentially to begin you just want to be in a position that is comfortable (you shouldn‚Äôt be in pain), but alert (you don‚Äôt want to fall asleep).  

Start with some deep breaths: in through the nose and out through the mouth. Gently close your eyes.

Turn your mind to the intent of this session: we‚Äôre doing this to grow closer with God.

In our first introduction session we encourage you to imagine yourself sitting on a bench next to God.  Don‚Äôt try to force any thoughts, just simply rest with Him for a few minutes.

Then gently open your eyes. Try not to move or check your phone right away. Just sit and take note of how you feel.

Most likely the first time you try this, you‚Äôll realize what many do when starting this journey ‚Äì our minds often race from one thing to the next. Silence is often uncomfortable.

The great news, though, is that God is here to help.  He‚Äôs already reaching out, always knocking at the door of our hearts‚Ä¶we just have to let Him in. By committing to spend even a few minutes in prayer each day, you‚Äôll have already taken that most important step towards opening your mind and heart to conversation with God.  The most important part for us is just to show up and try.

2. The Jesuit Examen ‚Äì Reflecting on your day

Okay, so now you‚Äôve begun to practice sitting in silence with God. What we‚Äôve found as a good next step is learning to see God and listen to God throughout your day. One of the best ways we‚Äôve found to build this practice is through the Examen.

The Examen is a technique developed by St. Ignatius of Loyola, a man born in Spain who served as a soldier before becoming a priest, theologian, founder of the Jesuit order, and renowned spiritual director. Even though he lived in the 15th and 16th centuries, his spiritual exercises are still widely practiced today.

The Examen is typically practiced at night as a way to review your whole day.

You begin in the same way you did before with Christian meditation. Find a comfortable and alert position, take some deep breaths, and acknowledge the intent of the prayer: that we‚Äôre doing this to grow closer with God.

Simply start then to walk through your day as if you‚Äôre replaying a movie in your mind: all the scenes and details, sights, sounds, tastes, smells, interactions with other people, and any challenges or joys. Notice occasions that really stand out ‚Äì for good or for bad ‚Äì and embrace the ordinary, mundane moments as well.

As you go through the day in your mind simply ask yourself, ‚ÄúWhere was God in these moments?‚Äù Ask the Holy Spirit for help ‚Äì help to show you where God was present and to guide us to the moments He wants to bring our attention to.

After you‚Äôve reviewed the day, reflect on it as a whole.  Call to mind the moments for which you were most grateful, savor them, and thank God.

Turn your mind to the moments you weren‚Äôt at your best, times when you felt stress or anxiety, when you might‚Äôve done wrong against someone or failed to do good for another person. Talk to God about these times and humbly ask for His forgiveness.

Then, start to think about tomorrow. What are you excited for? What are you nervous about? Visualize yourself walking through the day with God and ask for His help.

Gently open your eyes. Thank God for the time together.

We‚Äôve found that this is an easy and effective way at the end of the day to help you build the practice of mindfulness and better recognizing God‚Äôs presence throughout the day.

3. Lectio Divina ‚Äì A conversation with God

Last, but certainly not least, is Lectio Divina ‚Äì the first method of prayer we cover that directly incorporates the Bible. Lectio Divina means ‚Äúdivine reading‚Äù in Latin and is a way of reading the Bible in which we gradually let go of our own agendas and open ourselves to what God is trying to say to us.

This prayer method works well at any point in the day; and, like the other methods, is best done in a consistent and quiet place. As always, we start with some deep breaths.

Then you turn to a passage from the Gospels and begin to read it very slowly.  It doesn‚Äôt matter which passage you pick, but it might help to start with passages you‚Äôre already familiar with. If you‚Äôre unsure, feel free to google the daily reading for Mass that day.   Within the app, these passages are assembled into different themes and read to you.

Typically, you only want to focus on a short passage, usually only a handful of verses. Read these verses as slowly and meditatively as you can and notice if a word, phrase or image stands out to you.

It may take reading the passage over again 2 to 3 times before a word or phrase calls out to you, but once you‚Äôve found it, sit with it. Hold it in your mind.

Then after a few minutes, begin to talk with God. Listen to what He‚Äôs trying to say to you through these words and then respond. Finally, as in the previous methods, spend some time at the end simply resting with God in His presence.

At the end of these prayers, we close with the prayer that Jesus taught us, the Our Father, and the sign of the cross. As you did before with the Gospels, try to pick a word from the Our Father to carry with you throughout the day.

In fact, the word that first stuck out to me during my first attempt at Lectio Divina was the name of the app ‚Äì the word hallow from the Our Father.

How do I actually get started?

This is a lot to digest ‚Äì and it‚Äôs only the tip of the iceberg. Plus, it all sounds great on paper, but as we all know, it‚Äôs so much harder to actually take the time every day to commit to spending time in prayer.

This is the reason why we‚Äôre so excited about Hallow. We think it gives an easy and accessible way to learn and practice the three methods outlined here, plus so many more ‚Äì such as meditations on the Daily Gospel, Rosary or Divine Mercy Chaplet, themed content on joy, humility, love, letting go, or calm, targeted challenges to rediscover traditional prayers like the Our Father, the Stations of the Cross, the Psalms, and the Saints, and Sleep Bible Stories and prayers to help us rest at night with God.

We believe Hallow can help you as it‚Äôs helped all of us on the team to build a habit of prayer through daily prayer reminders and a journal to help you keep track of your journey. There is a free version of the app available and an optional upgrade to Hallow Plus that starts with a 2-week free trial and then is either $8.99 per month or $59.99 per year (20% less than the leading meditation apps). For every one subscription purchased, one will be given away for free to those who can‚Äôt afford it, but are looking to grow in their faith lives (e.g., candidates in adult Christian formation programs, those who can‚Äôt afford it).

I have personally started praying with all three throughout my week ‚Äì rotating between Lectio and Meditation each morning with the Examen or Night Prayer at night. The routine has dramatically changed and deepened my relationship with God. I have felt happier, more at peace, more joyful, more thankful and I have started to discover a real friendship with God. I get to wake up each day and enter into a conversation with God. We joke, we laugh; He pushes me, He helps me. When I get a tough email, need to have a difficult conversation, or disappoint myself, I have someone to lean on. And when things go well, and I‚Äôm reminded of my blessings, I get to share in the gratitude with God. I am still very much a sinner and am only just beginning my relationship with God, but my hope is that we can all embark on this wonderful adventure with Him together.

All of us here at Hallow just want to say thank you. We appreciate you taking the time to read our story. Feel free to share this blog or the app with your friends and family or reach out to us if you have any questions at all.  Know that we‚Äôre praying for you and your journey in faith and are blessed to get to be a part of it with you.

Peace be with you,

Alex (Co-founder and CEO of Hallow) and the Hallow team

What‚Äôs the Difference Between ‚ÄòMindfulness Meditation‚Äô and Christian Meditation

Alex Jones

Facebook

Twitter

Pinterest

This is a question we get asked a lot, and it‚Äôs a question we ourselves wrestled with for a while.

When we first started looking into this, the first thing we started to learn was that there are many, many different types of prayer: group prayer, chant, spiritual reading, reflecting on your day, and much more. And each is unique in its own way. But the one that seems the closest to the Eastern, Buddhist, and Agnostic meditation practices is a type of prayer called Christian meditation. What we came to realize, though, is that this practice is different a number of ways. I‚Äôll talk about 3 of the most important here.

1. Why we do it

So, the first difference comes down to why we‚Äôre doing it in the first place. To be honest, I was a big fan of many aspects of eastern meditation ‚Äì I meditated largely through eastern and secular methods for 3 years. Those practices were always framed as a ‚Äòself-improvement‚Äô exercise. You spend the time ‚Äòworking out‚Äô your mind to try to build the ability to be more present (aka mindful) and to better yourself. Now there is nothing inherently wrong or right with that, but Christian meditation and prayer is distinctively different.

 The point of Christian prayer and meditation is to grow deeper in a relationship ‚Äì a relationship with God. Sure, through this relationship you become a better person and more mindful, but that is not the primary goal. The primary goal is simply to sit with and spend time with a friend. It‚Äôs not to work out and to get stronger yourself, but simply to sit with God. It takes hard work, but it is less like a work out and more like simply spending the time to be with someone who loves you.

2. How we do it

The ‚Äòhow‚Äô is the second biggest difference. The eastern and secular mindfulness meditation methods I had tried were focused largely inward. Focused on your body, your breath and your mind. Whereas Buddhism (caveat: I am by no means an expert in Buddhism) does explicitly teach a focus on selflessness ‚Äì the practice of mindfulness meditation has been shown in some studies actually to increase self-centeredness. Recent studies conducted out of the University of Mannheim in Germany showed that those who practice eastern yoga and meditation have higher levels of ‚Äòself-enhancement‚Äô (a measure that includes how participants perceive themselves relative to others and slight narcissism) than those who didn‚Äôt.

This is where Christian meditation hopes to differentiate. It often begins with much of the similar focus on the body and breath in order to re-collect and ground yourself at the beginning of the session, but the session will always shift to the ultimate goal: to focus on something‚Ä¶or Someone outside of yourself. To humble yourself with the realization that you‚Äôre sitting in the presence of God. And through this new kind of mindfulness, to become closer to, and more like, God.

The other big difference I‚Äôll cite in terms of the ‚Äòhow‚Äô is who really is in control. In eastern practices, the more you practice letting your thoughts pass by, the better you get at it. They teach you to not force anything, but in the end, it‚Äôs you who is doing the work to improve. In Christian prayer, this isn‚Äôt the case. You‚Äôre not the one doing the work. Our work is simply to put ourselves in the position to let God take over. Simply to open the door to God. He‚Äôll do the rest. Now I say ‚Äòsimply‚Äô here, but there is still nothing simple or easy about this. In our world of business and noise, sitting in silence with God can be incredibly challenging. And that is why we‚Äôre here ‚Äì to help. But at the end of the day, we‚Äôre not the ones moving the needle ‚Äì not the ones doing the real work ‚Äì and in our experience, that realization has been freeing.

3. What you get out of it

This is the last big difference I‚Äôll talk about today. The goal of mindfulness meditation is often described as finding calm, escaping stress, relieving anxiety, becoming happier etc. It‚Äôs different in Christian meditation. While it is calming, peaceful and joyful in many ways to have God playing a bigger role in your life, the Christian life is by no means free from stress and anxiety, suffering or sadness.

RELATED: Prayers for Anxiety

Jesus had a pretty tough and difficult life. The night before He was tortured to death Luke writes ‚Äú[Jesus] was in such agony and he prayed so fervently.‚Äù and in his distress, even Jesus says, ‚ÄúFather, if you are willing, take this cup away from me‚Ä¶‚Äù

He did not live an easy and stress-free life. He did not spend his time sitting by an ocean watching the waves pass in pure peace and tranquility. It was a life of difficulty and struggle. So, then what is the point of Christian prayer? If I‚Äôm not trying to relieve stress or anxiety, what‚Äôs the point? Well you may have noticed I left out a pretty critical part of that line above from Luke‚Äôs Gospel:

‚ÄúFather, if you are willing, take this cup away from me‚Ä¶ still, not my will but yours be done.‚Äù

It is this last part that we strive for in our Christian meditation and our broader prayer lives. To somehow be willing to wake up each day, listen for God in our lives, and to say, ‚Äúnot my will but yours be done.‚Äù

The beauty of this is that it does end up leading largely to a life that is fuller with His joy and peace. A life in which we surrender our stresses and anxieties to God. After all, this is still the God who, as the psalmist writes, ‚Äúmakes me lie down in green pastures‚Äù and ‚Äúleads me besides still waters.‚Äù The key in prayer is the seeking of peace, calm and tranquility is not the end-all be-all. It‚Äôs not what we put first. We instead put God first. Put first not just mindfulness, but a mindfulness of His presence in our lives. We pray for the courage and grace to grow closer to Him‚Ä¶to follow Him. Not to ask Him for the things that we want, but instead for what He wants. To drink from the cup that He asks us to drink. To trust that He is leading us just a little bit closer to where we are supposed to be, just a little bit closer to Love, just a little bit closer to Heaven.

Everyone nowadays seems like they want to change the world. And frankly, we‚Äôre no different. We desperately think the world needs to change. Needs to become a radically different and more loving place. The only difference is that through prayer we stop trying to change the world, and start trying to let Him change it through us. Start trying to let Him make our world holy through us ‚Äì to let Him hallow our lives.
