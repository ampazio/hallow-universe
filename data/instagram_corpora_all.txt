I still remember the day I came to faith. I was 6 years old, sitting in what we called “big church” with my parents and the preacher did the typical “if any of you haven’t accepted Jesus as your Savior and feel led to do so now, pray this with me” speil and in that moment I felt called to this journey. I accepted Christ as my savior that day and got baptized shortly after. The journey has been a difficult one so far, I don’t always (or even usually) feel like the best Christian, but I’m trying and know that my faith will lead me to great things. I find it difficult to be motivated to do the things necessary to maintain my faith: attending church, reading my bible, and praying, but as soon as I do, I feel a wave of calm come over me.

I feel the farthest from God during the mundane parts of life. It’s easy for me to recognize God in my life during the highs and lows, but ordinary life poses problems for me. That’s why I think daily prayer is important, but I really struggle to keep this an important part of my life. I don’t want my relationship with God only to be in the good or bad times, I want it to be every part of my life. (Elise Van Dieren) #HumansofHallow

I've felt distant from God a lot of times, sometimes even when I was still pushing myself to lead youth group and push myself in faith. Often this distance has coincided with the worst times of my depression, which I've experienced since about 13. So much of my faith is what I feel, and depression has the tendency to rob me of that ability to feel which leads to a big distance in my relationship with God. Learning the stories of saints and other faith leaders who have felt similarly helped a lot. More so, developing healthy ways of dealing with my depression through faith have also helped. I learned that even if I can't feel what I often feel in faith, I can always serve others and that helps root me in my faith and bring me back to God. Lastly, developing coping and overcoming habits helped me learn how to connect through depression and open up about it, and I found tremendous strength sharing with my closest parish friends and going through the journey together, especially since I found out one of my friends was also struggling greatly. This always makes me think back to the gospel story in which a demon possesses a man and he can't speak (Matthew 9:32-33). Jesus drives out this demon which allows him to speak again. This shows me how God gave us the ability to communicate with others because it is good and powerful. Satan robs this man of speaking because when we share with others who want our good, we create a powerful force of connection that creates more good. God created us to connect!

I first accepted Christ when i was around 9 years old and since then it was kind of a rollercoaster. Sometimes i would feel really close to God and other time i would feel really distant. As i got older i started to feel more distant from God just because i feel like I’ve gotten so busy with other things in my life that i haven’t made time for Him in my life but i still feel that need to be close to Him and there are many times i find myself running back in hard times and taking a minute to talk to Him and be in His presence.

My relationship with God has definitely taken its fair share of twists and turns. For years growing up as a kid I did not enjoy going to mass. It was just another chore that my parents made me do on Sunday mornings. Then, when I entered my Catholic high school I began to put a little bit more effort in my faith life. With the support and encouragement of my Aunt and Grandma I went through the classes and got confirmed. This is a decision I will be thankful for the rest of my life. It wasn’t until my freshman year at Notre Dame that I began to take a lead in developing my own faith life. Previously I went to mass and worshiped God not by my own desire but really because other people wanted me to. Once I got to Notre Dame this changed. I found that I truly enjoyed going to Thursday night milkshake mass in my dorm and that I looked forward to it for the whole week. It was an hour of peacefulness and celebration that helped me to stay centered and focused in my faith life and my academic life. I really enjoy exploring my faith life with peers at my side who are going through a similar life phase as I am. I feel now that I have finally began to develop my faith on my own terms and that I am really working to define my faith in ways that are meaningful to me. Still, I would be lying I said I was a perfect Catholic. I eat meat during lent because I don’t enjoy eating fish and if I miss mass because of late Thursday night homework it isn’t the end of the world, but my faith is more important to me now than it ever has been before. I expect that I will continue to develop and grow my faith through my years at Notre Dame and for many years in the future. I wouldn’t be where I am today in my faith journey without the constant support of my Aunt and my Grandma, two of the two most faithful people I know, and of course, Notre Dame.

There was a point last fall when I was going through some mental health issues and I was sitting on one of the benches by the grotto that overlooks the lake at dusk just feeling really helpless and I asked God to give me a sign that I was going to be ok and right then an airplane passed over the lake. And I really believed that was a sign because I always watch the airplanes pass over my house in Florida so it made me feel safe and at home.
(Marina Maldi) #HumansofHallow

I pray every morning, every night, during my drives to work and during my walks to class. But it’s hardly ever a formal prayer. I talk to God, tell him my worries and ask for strength to take on a new day. I’m definitely guilty of praying more often throughout the day when I’m stressed or nervous about something, but I try to set aside time each day to thank God for what he’s given me without asking for more. I used to read verses in the Bible every day when I was in high school...unfortunately, I’ve allowed life to get in the way of that. I don’t read it every day anymore but I have a Bible on my night stand so I try to pick it up as often as I can. I do find it difficult to find time to read the word. It’s not because I’m busy every minute of every day. It’s more because my mind is so occupied with other thoughts that I almost forget to read the word daily. This is something I’m trying to work on. I’d say my relationship with God is semi-strong but could use a lot of improvement, I haven’t been going to church as often as I should and I don’t pray in quiet spaces as much as I’d like to. When I was 16, right after my sophomore year, my parents moved me to a new city, new high school & completely new people. I was furious. I refused to let myself get close to anyone in my new high school for 3 months. But after praying and trying to identify God’s purpose in moving me away from my old town, the switch was sudden. I quickly began to make good friends, grew closer to my teachers and ended up loving my new high school TREMENDOUSLY more than my old high school. Looking back, I’m 100% grateful that I moved. I had the best Junior and Senior year there.

I grew up Catholic. I attended youth group almost weekly, volunteered on behalf of my Church, and attended mass weekly. In many ways I was a poster Catholic from a poster Catholic family. My parents are devout Catholics, as is the entirety of my extended family. Family dinners, gatherings, and dinners revolve around mass. Yet, I disagree with the Church on virtually every major social issue and find the USCCB grossly out of sync with Catholic social justice. That said, I remain faithful and Catholic.
As I began to decipher my own opinions and beliefs, I initially distanced myself from the Catholic Church. Notably, I stopped going to mass. For three months I virtually ignored the Church, fed up with its abuse scandals, preservation of the patriarchy, and respective social teachings. Yet, I found myself longing for the tradition and community of the Catholic Church. I missed Sunday night mass in my dorm. No matter how angry or discouraged I was, I felt myself longing for the Church I grew up loving.
Today, I remain Catholic and once again attend mass. Though I continue to disagree with the Church regarding its biblical interpretations and application of social justice, I’ve come to the realization that faith is far more important. The Catholic Church and faith are synonymous. Perhaps, my disagreements with the Catholic Church are ignorant or perhaps the Church is flawed in its dispositions. Regardless, faith transcends these divides and brings us closer to divine revelation. (Andrew Rabbitt) #HumansofHallow

A time that I truly felt God’s presence was my first time at Church camp. Growing up in church, I never truly had a relationship with God. I treated faith as something I was obligated to participate in. As my six-grade year ended, my parents sent me to Extreme Kids Camp in New Mexico. I truly had one of the best Camp Experiences of my life. One on one time with my bible and no outside distractions really changed my perspective on faith. Although new challenges present themselves every day, I continue to strive to grow closer to God every day! (Avery Marler) #HumansofHallow

When I was in 8th grade, I got to play Mary in my church’s pageant production. I was so excited because I got to sing a solo, and hold a baby for most of the show. At the end of the show, I was walking down the aisle to meet my parents, when an old man approached me. He had the warmest smile on his face, and he told me how beautiful it was to watch me play Mary and how wonderful it was to see me want to hold that baby so much. For some reason, as he was talking, I reached out and held his hand. It was the strangest thing in the world, because I didn’t even remember grabbing it, or why I grabbed it, I just suddenly did. And I had the weirdest peaceful sensation all over my body. When he was finished talking, he squeezed my hand and walked away, but I still had the weirdest feeling all over. I believe that is God, and the presence of God. I have never felt more inexplicably at peace and safe in any moment before, and I know it was God who compelled me to hold that man’s hand.

I have always felt in touch with God growing in my faith life. However, I felt doubt in him when I found out my younger sister was born with profound hearing loss. Hearing this news was so heartbreaking to think that my own sister couldn’t even hear my voice. While she was able to receive the Cochlear Implant that gave her the belated gift of hearing, she had missed the most important year of her life to acquire speech, which gave her a severe speech deficit. I felt betrayed by God that he would let her experience this type of loss, and put my parents and me through watching her struggle. However, one year got better with the next as we constantly pushed her to speak English at her level from giving up Spanish at home to taking photos of everyday items and quizzing her on pronouncing them. While every year she improved, it seemed that she still couldn’t speak normally, which just broke my heart, and left my wondering why God would let this happen. I learned that God’s work is never instant, it is not always right in front of you. It took over ten years for my sister to excel in her speech and be at a spot equivalent to her peers. Now, I see God in just the small late night conversations her and I have before falling asleep, in the little arguments over which scrunchies belong to whom, in our singing in the car, something I only dreamed of ten years ago. God’s work is so mighty and so beautiful, but it is seldom presented instantly, and rather takes patience.
(Sammy Garcia) #HumansofHallow

My faith has developed over the years, growing up in a faith community and doing youth group, mission trips, and making many great church friends.  My true test of faith was coming to college when that faith family was hundreds of miles away, but it's actually brought me closer to God because I've had the opportunity to form new friendships and talk to people who have had different faith experiences from myself. My faith in God always was at its strongest in high school on mission trips with my church, but especially at the Christian sleepaway summer camp I attended for five years.  These were some of the happiest times of my life.  On mission trips, my faith was applied to a good purpose, and at summer camp there was so much peace, free time, friendship, and lack of distractions that really helped me to fully immerse myself in Him.

(1/2) I always seem to find myself closest to God when things are going well and furthest apart when they aren’t. I was raised in a big Catholic family that goes to church every Sunday, and my dad even teaches Sunday school there each week. I’ve never been that religious, but I try to be a grateful person, so I felt my life was going smoothly, I thanked God for it. If it wasn’t, I blamed myself – Bad things can’t be God’s fault, right? He’s supposed to be the good guy. But that felt unfair, and I grew frustrated with Catholicism as a whole. As soon as I realized that I only saw God in the good and never in the bad, I knew that I didn’t truly see Him. Shouldn’t God be everywhere? Isn’t that like, the whole thing? I’ve struggled with this for a while. How can I fully support a God that lets bad things happen? Why doesn’t He stop all of this? I reached peak frustration when I went to college, and I think that although I went to a Catholic university, my connection to Catholicism itself has only diminished since I began.

(2/2) I think the catalyst that made me rethink my faith was when my autoimmune disorder relapsed. I’d been sick all through elementary and most of middle school, but I was finally in remission by about seventh grade. For a couple of years, I felt great, and my family thanked God each time it was mentioned. I’d been legally dead, and it was God’s grace that saved me. I had been getting worse, and it was God that brought me back. My doctors had been struggling with finding the right medicines, and it was God that helped them figure it out. Then it came back, and no one mentioned God. I was back in the hospital each week, getting infusions and MRIs all over again. If God isn’t there to support me in my bad times, what’s the point? And shouldn’t the doctors get some of the credit? Objectively, they saved me. How come God gets all the credit but none of the blame? That being said, this also made me realize that faith is what you make of it, and I do still get some comfort out of attending mass or praying. When I go to mass, I remember going with my family back home and feel connected to my parents. When I pray, I feel the God that I see in the good. I don’t necessarily agree with each tenant of Catholicism or even remain very adamant about my faith, but each time I take the time to go to a service or pray, I see the good, I relax, and I feel comforted.
(Katie Lewis 2/2) #HumansofHallow

Looking back on growing up, one thing that I realize was kind of unique was my emphasis on praying to my Guardian Angel - that was something my mom really helped me focus on from an early age. Eventually I started thinking about “okay I’m praying to my Guardian Angel” - what does that mean - how does that relate to praying to Jesus?

So that was my initial, early prayer when I was young and then when I got to high school I was much more lax about it. I didn’t really want to pray or go to church. I still had a lot of questions and it wasn’t until college when I read some really inspiring books like "Doing the Truth Through Love" and "Confessions", had some really cool discussions with friends, and went to theology classes that I realized there was a lot more to it. I really liked discovering it more on my own as opposed to it being kind of forced on me.

Recently I was in Panama. The whole focus was on Mary and her fiat, or her “yes”, her faith...I was reflecting on that and was with some friends and we were walking to a pilgrimage site and we were on our way and doing the Rosary out loud as I’ve done a thousand times before. There wasn’t anything that prompted it, but this particular time as I was reading out the mysteries as we were walking, at the last word of the mystery I would just feel this overwhelming flurry of emotions. It happened in an instant and then it went away very quickly, but it was a mixture of joy, sadness, relief, confusion all at once and then it dissipated very quickly. It happened every time I would finish a mystery. I don't know what it was, but it was one of the most powerful feelings I’ve ever had. It made me really want to keep at least trying to find God in prayer. #HumansofHallow

One of the verses that encourages me to spread my story and encourage people to live a Christian lifestyle is Acts 20:35 which says “I have revealed all things to you, because by laboring in this way, it is necessary to support the weak and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive’”. The platform I have been given at the University of Notre Dame is more than I ever could have dreamed of and it is only through God that I have been given the opportunity to share my faith and encourage others to explore their faith as well.

There is so much to be anxious about in everyday life. Personally, some days my anxiety really gets the best of me and I don’t know where to turn or what to do in my life. Sometimes, we get so caught up in our problems that we forget there is an entire world out there. Right around the time my anxiety heightened, I started developing an open dialogue with God where I can pray about the things I worry about. God has truly helped guide me in the right direction and, even if things don’t always workout the way I planned, praying always brings me a level of comfort and humility that reminds me that no matter what, God is above all and everything will be okay.

Now when I pray it kind of helps me organize thoughts you know - the things that I’m asking God for and the issues I have in my life come together when I’m actually like “Lord please help me with this, this, this, and that”...so then I wake up in the morning, I have the list from my prayer the night before and it’s like God is helping me solve each problem that I thought of, of course with hard work, but instead of just saying it’ll be a miracle and all happen at once, it helps me to single out the most important things. #HumansofHallow

I’ve been back and forth to Baltimore these last few months, I’m helping my daughter with the new baby. But my husband, he stays at home, he’s too worried about the house and our other daughter to leave. She has the Parkinsons, so we help with her kids too. Honestly, I don’t know how I did it before — babies, I mean this is a young person’s job. I raised six kids myself, but I don’t have that kind of energy anymore. We try to come to church when we can, but it’s so hard getting everybody all dressed and ready on time. But it’s Jesus, every morning it’s Jesus I get myself up for. I owe so much of my life to Jesus. My husband, he did come down here for his radiation for two weeks, so I stayed back home. He has cancer. Esophagus cancer, it’s terminal. I don’t think he quite understands that though. It’s been almost two years, he shouldn’t really be alive. I remember one doctor he had down here, he asked her “Have you had any other patients live this long with this kind of cancer?” She grew very somber, real quiet. And she just shook her head.
So I’m going back up there on Tuesday. I need to be with him. I wish we had more time, just to relax and be there with each other. But our kids, there’s always so much to do for them. We help where we can.
We’ve got a lot of medical people in our family, you know I went back to school to finish my BSN when I was 62. They thought I was crazy. But my husband and I, we really value education. We tried to instill that in our kids, how important education is. My kids now, they all have such amazing lives, and when they look back they tell me “Mom, we used to be so poor.” But I don’t think we were. We had everything we could ever need. We still do. #HumansofHallow

As a server, I struggle to see God in people sometimes. Every time I get stiffed or yelled at I wonder how God could be present in these times but then I sit down and realize God has to test me sometimes and it helps build my patience. When I get $50 or $100 tips I remember there is good in the world and sometimes you have to take the good with the bad. #HumansofHallow

When I was younger, I think I did a lot of asking prayer like I want this, I want that, like a kid asking his parents what he wants. But as I got older, my prayer is more about help me understand what you are trying to do and help me see your plan, not my plan. And to come to peace with it. #HumansofHallow

When I was young and in my 20s, there was a time i didn’t really go to mass regularly...I went through a period of a lot of self-doubt, and, depression, and I just remember thinking about giving up and it’s like that cliche that you always read about. It’s like you’re at the bottom of a pit and you look up and it’s like you see a light and I really had that experience. I really felt like it was God calling me to go on. That there was a purpose to my life. I’ll never forget that. And I thought well all you can do is just keep putting one foot in front of the other right? I’ll never forget that. #HumansofHallow

My mother used to pray to her Guardian Angel and pray the rosary all the time. I go to mass on Sundays, but I’m still trying to figure out where God fits personally into my own life. All I know is that when I go to church, it’s when I feel closest to my mom and it’s where I can say thanks. Most of the time when I talk to God it’s just to say thank you. #HumansofHallow

I think I’ve had a really big transformation, just by all the ways i’ve redefined my faith. I used to think of it in more of a complex way, but as I’ve grown older it got simpler. I still go to church all the time, but I think when I was younger I felt like I needed to do all these things, but I learned through mass that it’s all about prayer and your own connection with God. Like you don’t have to do certain things, it’s just self-elected what you want to do and what you feel is important. I’ve learned how to go deeper within prayer... Back then I thought it was a genie in a bottle thing and now I know you don’t just get to wish for things...It became more of a conversation rather than just saying things. #HumansofHallow

I would say that I first came to faith seriously in high school when I surrounded myself with others who shared my same beliefs and encouraged me to grow and walk closely with Christ. Around my sophomore year I started combining my love for music with my love of service and joined the band at Crossroads. The Crossroads volunteer team became like a second family to me, and since they always held me accountable, I felt like my relationship with God was impacted in amazing ways during my time with them. When I went to college this past year, however, I found myself surrounded by people who did not share my faith or beliefs and I found that extremely difficult. One of the biggest challenges I faced was upholding my faith and not falling to temptations. I definitely made my fair share of mistakes, but after the first semester I stopped and asked God to help me find my way back to him. After lots of prayer and self evaluating, I found myself in a much more stable place when it came to my faith the second semester of my freshman year. I learned how to pray for those who don’t share the same beliefs as me, and for those I may not get along with so well. I also feel like I gained the strength to stand up for my ideals in tempting situations, which I’m extremely grateful for. Most importantly, I feel like God really spoke to me about the type of life he wants me to lead now and in the future. My eyes are focused on Him, and I intend to continue to make my walk with Christ my first priority, and then have faith that everything else will fall into place when the time is right #HumansofHallow

"Even though my family is super Catholic, I really took it upon myself to make sure that I wanted to follow the faith - independent of what they thought. When I went to a huge public state school for college, I took some time to figure out if Catholicism was right for me.

After a lot of exploration, I was sitting waiting for the bus one day when I felt a wave of calm... and realized that my faith was my soul... and even if I don’t practice in the same way as my parents - that’s okay. Now I have a stronger relationship with God than ever." - Catherine from NJ #HumansofHallow

"I had a beautiful upbringing in the Catholic faith, but for a long time, I was just going through the motions. I eventually realized that you can’t just check off boxes and not everything is going to be perfect all the time. I had experiences that really knocked me down and faith took on a new light when I realized that it wasn’t about proving myself to be a certain way or a perfect person but rather being loved exactly as I am. I had to get my ego out of the way so that God could take control. Now, my faith isn’t always perfect, but I definitely have a solid ground.

Sometimes I rush wanting to know what the rest of my life will hold. Where will I be in 5 years? Who will I be with? I can sometimes get frustrated if I don’t see God in something or if I don’t hear him. But I try to stay in the present. If I catch myself thinking too far into the future, I just think that it’s in God’s hands and he’ll let me know when I need to know.

I think that my relationship with God is the simplest and strongest it’s ever been. I often like to sit in quiet and just feel his presence and love and place me and everyone in my life in his trusting hands. I’m so aware of how much he is working in my life and how I’m allowing him to and witnessing how that’s the best way to be. Our relationship deepens as I learn to do that more."

“I struggle with saying “thank you” to God. It really bothers me that I feel like I can only go to Him when I need help... and I feel bad for only relying on God when it’s convenient for me.
In life in general I think we all forget to stop and appreciate what we have because we are so caught up in getting the next thing.
I am currently still looking for a way to slow myself down and smell the roses, stopping to say “thank you.”
- Cate from NJ #HumansofHallow

“Right now I’ve been bringing God into every little thing that I can. I think that because of the Fall we're kind of on this treadmill taking us backwards and if we don't pursue God and keep growing we're gonna fall on our face. There’s this quote by C.S. Lewis, he says, “Every split second is either claimed by God or counter-claimed by Satan.” There's no neutrality. And so I've just been bringing God into all the small things in my life.” -Adam #HumansofHallow

"My relationship with God means that I’m not able to do everything that I see my friends do. It means I have a responsibility. It holds me accountable to do the things I know God’s placed in my heart. It’s not always the easiest decision. My dad told me something when I was younger that I didn’t understand until recently. He said: “There are some things that other people are going to do that you’ll never be able to do, but there are some things that you’ll do, that no one will ever be able to do in their wildest dreams.” In agreeing to be in a relationship with God, you need to put away your selfish desires. And sometimes you suck at it, but you try again tomorrow and know that God will still love you." -Kaliyah #HumansofHallow

(1/3) “I was born in communist Poland and raised there in a really impoverished community. But I also didn’t know a single person who didn’t go to church - drunks, smokers, sinners, those who beat their wives, those who beat their children, everyone. My grandfather was the greatest example of faith in my life, though, and he was a very simple person. He was illiterate, but so hardworking. He worked dawn til dusk. I spent summers with him and my grandmother because I had a single mother who needed help. And my grandfather woke up every single day, washed himself, combed his hair, and before breakfast, he would kneel and pray in front of the kitchen table before his food. He didn’t start his day until he prayed. And he ended his days the same way. For me, as a child, I don’t remember anyone who prayed like he did. But that image stayed with me - that this person couldn’t even start his day without praying to God. And that you could believe without even being able to read the Bible.” #HumansofHallow

(2/3) “When I was a little bit older, probably high school, priests became very important in my life. I didn’t have a father, so I just looked for father figures around me. The priests I got to know at the churches I went to showed me a different way to love. They were so caring and wise. Some of them had a simple faith, like my grandfather, and some of them had a more theological background. One of my priests is still my friend to this day. He still sends me his weekly homily. His homilies are short, but they stick with you. These priests helped me understand my faith.” #HumansofHallow

(3/3) “I came to the United States in 1989, the same year communism fell in Poland. I came alone, with just one suitcase and no English language, and lived with my friends in a small apartment in New York. I cleaned houses and never dreamed that maybe one day I would live here and own my own house, have my own children… I met and married my husband. He died three years ago now. When he died, I stopped praying. I didn’t know how to pray the Our Father anymore. I got to the part where you say, ‘Thy will be done,’ and couldn’t say that. How could something so terrible, beyond human comprehension, be God’s will? But I waited out those dark times and eventually learned to pray again. There’s a song you sing during adoration, Tantum Ergo Sacramentum, and the last line is, ‘Let faith provide a supplement for the failure of the senses.’ I guess there is something I can’t understand that God wants, and I believe that. A lot of different men shaped my prayer life, but my husband was a wonderful man. Our goal was to raise our children with a strong faith. I think it worked out.” -Ewa (Translated from Polish by the interviewer) #HumansofHallow

"I didn't realize until later, like ‘Hold up, this is kind of a really big question.’ Like if heaven and hell could actually possibly be real things after death, that's a wildly big deal with a ton at stake - it's a big enough deal that it's at least worth exploring and figuring out where I stand. And if I decide to believe it or not, then I should be able to say exactly why instead of just claiming I believe because it's how I grew up or claiming I don't believe because it's an easier life to live. I've still got a ways to go, but I'm at least a lot more intentional about the way I'm exploring, and the more I dig into it, the deeper I've grown in my spirituality and faith.” -Erich #HumansofHallow

“Senior year, I was an RA in my dorm and I really bonded with one of the Assistant Rectors. She is of a different faith, but the way she practiced and gave herself to the Lord and others was really awe-inspiring. One of the ‘requirements’ of being an AR or RA is going to mass every Sunday, and even though this person didn’t technically have to come to mass with everyone, she always would. After she had been to church already that day with her family. She always made it a point to make sure she was learning and could be a resource for other students.” -Dom #HumansofHallow

“Even though having a child is the best thing in the world, when my son was born it was really, really tough. My wife had a traumatic birth experience that left us feeling like God wasn't present. And I've never been so tired, which compounded that frustration and anger I had towards God. Also, my son was born in the middle of all the abuse coming to light in the Church, so it didn't feel like we had a safe place to turn to. Honestly, Hallow was one of the biggest things that helped me gain trust in God again and slowly start coming back to the Church. I would stay up and pray the rosary with my son whenever he wouldn't sleep and ended up using his middle of the night wakings to pray and journal and watch a lot of Netflix, too! All of that, plus time passing softened the anger and frustration I had and eventually my wife and I were able to find a great faith community to be a part of.” -Joe #HumansofHallow

“I was in 7th grade, my mom got breast cancer. And she was always like the strongest one in the household, never was sick, always getting everyone to school. And I was like, ‘How did she do it?’ She always had a smile on her face. So when she got sick, it was like, well if she’s vulnerable, I just need to thank God for every day... It was kind of like nothing could ever happen to her. Made you really rethink and be thankful for every day. So every day when I woke up, I started with a prayer. Then I got selected to go play soccer in college and I knew it was a sign because I would always pray, ‘If it’s not for me, I won’t do it,’ but I always put in there to God, ‘But I always want to do it!’ And I always hoped that it would work out. I always got blessings, too, and it was always consistent that I was never alone in soccer. Whenever I’m out in the field, I never feel like I’m alone. I never feel nervous about games because whatever happens, happens. And I know that he’s watching over me. He’s helped me realized that not everyone gets to do what they love and I’m very blessed to get to do what I love every single day.” -Mark #HumansofHallow

(1/3) “I got sick when I was 9 years old and we later found out I was diagnosed with anxiety, PTSD, bipolar 2, and anorexia nervosa. And so most of my life after that point, you know, everything changes. There’s no more social events, no more Christmases, no more holidays, no more happiness. Your world just flips upside down and you’re thrown into chaos and you’re just along for the ride. It’s your brain, but it’s not you. So when I was 10 years old, I just walked away from the Church. I threw out my Bible and said, ‘Screw you.’ My eyes were opened at a very young age to the world of suffering and I was too innocent, I was not ready for it. I was hospitalized 7 times in 15 years. I had a lot of trauma.” #HumansofHallow

(2/3) “But the hardest thing over that time period was I had one best friend, and in 2015 I actually overdosed. And she saved my life. And then a year later, she took her life. And I couldn’t save her... That was the most challenging part of my faith life. But I actually had a vision, a miracle, happen. After she passed, I ran outside and I was screaming at God. My life was a mess. ‘Why would you do this?’ In doing so, it started raining, of course, and Tori, my friend, she appeared to me and she grabbed for my hand, and then Christ appeared to me. She took my hand and she put it into Christ’s hand. She said, ‘It’s time to let go. It’s ok. He hasn’t forgotten you and He still loves you.’” #HumansofHallow

(3/3) “Since then, I’ve come back to the Church. I made a promise to Tori and to God that I’m allowed to be angry, I’m allowed to be confused. Certain people have to go through such suffering. But, I’m allowed to be all those things and I can still show up to Mass. I can still tell God, ‘I don’t understand.’ I can still have that relationship with Him.” -Maria #HumansofHallow

“We went to Fatima 28 years ago and we were trying to conceive a baby. When we came home, we had one! And when we were there, we were touring on our own. We rented a car to go from Portugal to Spain.  We were warned to be careful in Portugal, to never leave our passports or suitcases in the car. We were given directions to get on the highway and get off at the second exit, but when we got on the highway we came across a road block. So we drive off the highway, and the only sign we saw pointed to Fatima. We decided to go to Fatima and leave our car parked to experience Fatima. It was a beautiful experience... then they rang the bell for mass, and as everyone was leaving to go to mass, I said to my husband, ‘This would be a good time to go to the exact spot where the children saw the Virgin Mary.’ And he said, ‘No, I think we need to go.’ And in my mind, I’m like, ‘Well I can argue this one!’ But I decided I wasn’t going to argue. And as I’m walking back to my car, I said to my husband, ‘There’s people by our car!’ They’re jiggling the door handle to get into our car. And when they saw us crossing the street to come to our car, they stopped and ran away. When we got to the car, the lock was opened, but they hadn’t opened the door yet! And then we got into the car. It felt safe. I felt the miracle of Fatima.” -Diane #HumansofHallow

“I was baptized in 2017. In the past, it hasn’t been easy. There are different things distracting me from God. I’ve learned that I don’t have to worry about anything, God has an ultimate plan for us and we just have to trust him.” -Anonymous #HumansofHallow

“Everyone has that thought of, ‘How could God let this happen?’ It’s such a weird thing. Our generation has never lived through world wars.  We’ve never lived through anything that has impacted our daily life as much as this. The concerns with it are a million-fold. You’re concerned about your family’s wellbeing, there’s health concerns, there’s economy concerns, your jobs, your parents’ retirement funds. We’re just worried about people. There’s this super deep concern for everyone you know. For me, I struggle with personal guilt because I haven’t been personally affected, really. But I have these pangs of anxiety and concern for other people and what they must be going through. So it’s one of those times where you’re like, ‘How can You let this happen?’ I don’t really remember 9/11 and there hasn’t been a homeland war that’s affected me, this has really just disrupted so much. I just want divine intervention so bad. You want to say to God, ‘Just take over. Just steer the ship, please.’” -Alex #HumansofHallow

“If you had asked me what my relationship with God was like nine years ago, I would have said, ‘I don’t really think about it.’ If you would have asked me that question six years ago, I would have said, ‘I don’t really know, but if I had to guess, I think God exists.’ If you had asked me that question three years ago, I would have said, ‘I can see the intellectual arguments for why God could exist and Christianity could be true, but I could also see the arguments for why not.’ And if you asked me that question today, I would probably say, ‘I don’t have perfect faith, and I’m sure a super intelligent person could convince me that God doesn’t exist, but it would be at the same level of convincing me that my wife doesn’t exist.’ It’s a real, living relationship that I have every day.” -Alex #HumansofHallow

“I struggle with saying “thank you” to God. It really bothers me that I feel like I can only go to Him when I need help... and I feel bad for only relying on God when it’s convenient for me.

In life in general I think we all forget to stop and appreciate what we have because we are so caught up in getting the next thing.

I am currently still looking for a way to slow myself down and smell the roses, stopping to say “thank you.” – Cate #HumansofHallow

“I've had countless moments where the Holy Spirit is speaking to me through the different sounds of nature and light. When you're out on a vista looking out, or you're out at a viewpoint and you can see for miles around you and hear the wind blowing, it's just a matter of, you know, letting go and just enjoying the moment. Sit back and just look out into the distance. I've had several of those moments in my life, throughout my career, that have moved me to tears. It's one of the most powerful things that you will ever experience as a Christian … whether you see an animal that's calling or you hear a bird chirping or you hear wind blowing, it's just a matter of kicking back and letting God speak to you through nature.” -Brandon #HumansofHallow

Jesus, I trust in you.

How relaxing was that meditation from Abby? Even just one minute of meditative prayer is a great way to start or end your day. It reminds us to slow down, find peace, and thank God for our blessings.

“I've been doing coaching - probably since the start of this year - more seriously and consistently. My coaching is specifically geared towards Catholic and Christian women because that was my journey. I realized that even though you can have a very robust, you know, faith life and prayer life, sometimes God is calling us to do a little bit more - calling us to do some more internal work or some healing work. 

I went on a personal development journey about three years ago, and I just was so inspired that I wanted to learn how to become a coach. I specifically wanted to help women who are like myself because there's so many coaches out there, but I find that women of faith tend to be a little bit more suspicious; just a little bit more reserved and not just gonna jump into any anything. I know there's a lot of new age stuff out there and, you know, you have to be prudent. So I basically said I want to be the coach that I was looking for when I was in my own process.” -Claudine  #humansofhallow

Ever struggled to figure out how to talk to your family and friends about prayer? 

Hallow's Content & Programming Lead, Joe shares some inspiration for how we can talk to our friends and families about prayer. 

"At Hallow, we’re inspired by this vision of prayer. But we also know that building a friendship with God – like all friendships – can be scary. It takes trust, accountability, forgiveness, humor, and patience."

Check out the link in our bio for more tips on having conversations about prayer.

“I think probably the biggest question that anyone will ever have to answer in their life is, "Who is God, and how do I relate to him and model my life after him?" 

I've had a very strong upbringing in the Catholic faith. It was very in my head, though. And it was very, I would say, doctrinal, if that's the right word. Where things really started to click for me was in undergrad. I went to Washington University in St. Louis. And I entered having that strong Catholic upbringing without really much diversity of thought in terms of my faith. I was introduced to the Catholic Student Center at Wash U, and I think my faith journey started then because it was a journey from my head to my heart … So I  started to understand God as love, that God loves me and loves all human beings. 

I started reading the Saints and I started delving into the desires of my heart. Really the biggest impetus was that I realized that all the big questions that I was contemplating in life and in my classes and in my relationships really started to point towards the fact that, this world, in the end, can’t really satisfy all of my desires and that there's this need for a savior. I think that's when I started to see my faith more as a relationship with God, and that I need His help.” -Jack #HumansofHallow

"At a very young age, my parents would pray with me every night before I went to bed. While there were many prayers that I was introduced to, one that sparked my interest was a poem called “Footprints” by Mary Stevenson. Every time I read this poem, I was comforted by the thought of God walking beside me. My relationship with God grew stronger because of it.” 

 "In high school, almost every morning I would get up and I would pray. However, my first semester of my senior year, my relationship with God started to crumble. It was directly after my father suddenly passed away. During that time I questioned my faith, and I struggled with finding a source of relief for the sorrow I carried and the unanswered questions about his after-life, such as "Is my dad able to watch over me now? Can he hear me?”

“It was a very difficult time, but fortunately, because I was attending a Catholic High School and had the support of my family and friends, I was able to slowly reconnect with God, and rebuild my faith."

“We all face our own personal trials and tribulations and mine helped me to better appreciate the many blessings that God has bestowed upon me." 

"It helped me to remember that I never was alone - that I never walk alone. When I remember I never walk alone, I think back to that poem. We all go through our own hardships, but God is always there walking with us – through it all." -Kayla #HumansofHallow

Did you know Lectio Divina means "divine reading" in Latin? Here are a few ways to get started praying Lectio Divina from Abby (our Head of Content and the beautiful female voice on Hallow). #HowToPray

"When I was first introduced to Lectio Divina, I chose the passage from the Gospel where Jesus teaches the Our Father. What stuck out to me during this first attempt at Lectio Divina became the name of our app – the word “hallow,” which means “to make holy.”

Abby shares her struggle with patience and how she learned to slow down, breathe, and find peace in prayer. #OnTheBlog 

She identifies three areas of patience necessary in our lives: 
1. Patience with God
2. Patience with others
3. Patience with ourselves 

“Have patience with all things, but chiefly have patience with yourself. Do not lose courage in considering your own imperfections, but instantly set about remedying them — every day begin the task anew.” -Saint Frances de Sales

“The first time I went to Eucharistic Adoration was at my confirmation retreat. It was during the evening, after all the activities and whatnot. As I sat there in front of the monstrance, it was the first time I actually felt the presence of God. It was this overwhelming sense of peace, and I remember saying to myself, “Okay, God, this life is yours, and I surrender everything.” And since then I have taken my faith seriously. And every time I receive the Eucharist I'm always reminded of that moment.” - Dante #HumansofHallow

“I truly had my encounter with God about ten years ago, even though I’ve been Catholic my whole life and doing everything related to living my faith. I feel like in the past ten to fifteen years I really came to understand what being Catholic means. So I feel like today, I’m in a place of being more in depth in my faith, and really having that relationship with God in a different way than if I was a kid or just going to church and participating there. I really feel the relationship with God now.” 

“Really having a conversation with God in prayer — that's the thing that changed me the most. Of course I still ask for things when I pray to God, but I ask him to talk to me and tell me what he wants for me and what he wants to leave me. For whatever decision I have to make, I have this conversation. I usually start with praying the Rosary and then I just stay quiet with God and say, “Where should I go now? What do you want me to do?” I try to use wisdom as much as I can, even if something doesn't happen the way that I was planning or the way that I was expecting. I understand that that’s God leading me to something better than I planned before.” - @carleara #HumansofHallow

“I'm in my mid 30s, and I have three kids, so my faith today is a lot different than it was when I first had a conversion in my early 20s. And the cool thing is that today my faith is much more familial. I get to practice my faith every single day — teaching my kids how to grow in their love for Jesus -- and I'm sharing my prayer life with my wife. So, in a way, it's a lot more challenging to have to be a spiritual leader. I say if there's one thing that really characterizes my faith today is that I'm firmly in a role where I'm a spiritual leader, whereas early on in my faith journey, I had a conversion fell in love with Jesus at 20 years old, and  I wanted to be a missionary. I did all the missionary work I could and just absolutely lived to spread the gospel. And so my faith was very, very apostolic. What has shifted, is how I express that apostolic zeal. Right now, it has to be has to be much more focused on teaching my children and spreading the Gospel in my home. But I think what's the same is both expressions of my faith, whether early on, or today, where I'm more of a spiritual leader to my small unit, is that both of them have to be deeply rooted in a love for Jesus, and a deep prayer life with Mary.” - @stephenjcaruso #HumansofHallow

“So looking back, when we went into quarantine in March, I had already been a pretty avid user of the app. I would use it for nighttime meditation, as well as just kind of winding down from my day. But the biggest thing with Hallow was Easter weekend when we had the 24 hour rosary. That was a game changer. It changed my life. I would say, going into quarantine I was feeling really tired and really just kind of confused about next steps, about what I wanted to do, not only just like with life, but like where I was as far as, you know, timing of things you know relationships, all of that, and that Easter weekend, specifically, completely reinvigorated my faith and full fledge got me back in - total.

I think I watched it as soon as it started, and I watched it till like two o'clock in the morning so every single hour I was doing that Rosary and I had it playing, even as I was sleeping so that I could still hear it. And then on that Easter Sunday I made a point to make sure I was there for the very last Rosary that we said, and oddly enough, a lot of the contacts I made, and then I've established some pretty good relationships were because of the Hallow app and because of that weekend.” @bellemarissa_xoxo #HumansofHallow #HallowApp #UserSpotlight

St. Jane believed the secret to happiness was in losing yourself in the Lord. When you find yourself lost in thoughts or worries, send them out to God and surround yourself in His infinite love.

“In just the last several years, my faith has just grown exponentially. It's incredible that you don't realize what kind of a situation you're in, until you've gotten out of it and you see how God carries you through every single situation. And then just over the last few years, it's just gotten even deeper. I mean I've had that personal relationship with Christ, not just the community. I've always had that, but now it's like okay, what does God really want for me? What am I supposed to do with my life, and how am I supposed to serve Him? How am I supposed to build His kingdom? I've really just been in awe of how God's worked in my life, and the things that he's put into my life when you ask him how you can serve Him, and I remember asking him because I knew my daughter was going to be leaving, and I thought, okay, I better start asking him where he wants me to be put, and I'm telling you, as soon as I said that He just put these opportunities in front of me. I started baby cuddling in the NICU and working with a transitional women's home - just different things just started coming to me.” - @colleenmscanlon #HumansofHallow

“I went to Mass very frequently when I was in college, and then when I got out of college, more infrequently. I was a young professional -- I was in consulting, so I was traveling and wasn't always consistent in mass. And I had definitely also gone up and down in my prayer life too. I would say I struggled with it for a long time, until maybe a year and a half ago when I really started like searching because I felt like something was missing. So I started searching, and I got involved with a women's Bible study group that was actually started by a girl who I went to high school with, and over the course of the last year with them, I really have had a huge transformation in my faith.
I would say that for the first six months it was more just me learning and observing from all the different ladies, but then after six months — it might have been just like one of those specific studies that we were doing — I just all of a sudden felt hungry for God and hungry for the Holy Spirit and for church and then for the Catholic faith in general. That's when I discovered Hallow.
When you ask about when there was a pivot point, it's probably within the last five to six months, which is kind of crazy considering I got married in the Catholic Church and I baptized my daughter in the Catholic Church along the way, but I think that for so many years, I was just uninformed. I think that was the thing — I didn't know anything about the faith. I didn't know anything about the traditions, and I think that that was a huge problem because I wasn't able to fully appreciate and fully devote myself to it.” - @taylorbhealthy (Hallow’s Growth Marketing Lead) #HumansofHallow

“In 2015 I was diagnosed with stage four colorectal cancer, and my faith life with God just really took off, and I really shouldn't be sitting here today, but because of his grace, I'm here. That's kind of when things really got deep. Then I had some family members who left the church… and they were bringing up a lot of things about our Catholic faith that I couldn't quite articulate, but that I knew that I didn’t agree with. So I decided to take a deeper dive into my faith journey at that point and start learning more about Catholicism. For me, I had this relationship with God and with Jesus, but I didn't necessarily know the pillars of understandings for my faith. So I spent a lot of time listening to Catholic radio, reading lots of different books, and then just really talking to God.
While working from home as a school teacher, I loved that I was able to stay devoted to the holy Rosary -- that’s something that's been part of my family for a really long time. My mom just passed away in July, so I say the Rosary daily with her rosary … My mom lived with me and my family, and she passed away young, at 63, from ALS. She was a big believer in God's plan for her. She was very joyful, and she prayed the Rosary daily for us. I had to clean up her room, but I didn’t want to do away with her things, so I turned it into an at-home chapel. I come down here to pray, and at 7 am, my phone says, “Here’s your quick reminder to pray” from Hallow, and I start my day off with that. I love it. I love growing deeper in my faith, especially in the time of this crazy world.
One thing that I’ve always felt since being a child is that no one can take your faith away from you.” - Aliscia @aliscia._marie #humansofhallow

“In March, the beginning quarantine, I was meditating every day, but I was looking for something with more intention because my meditation usually felt so inward, whereas Hallow gives me an opportunity to find the bigger picture. It gives me permission, first, and then tools to talk to God, in a way that’s calming and reassuring, not in a way that’s efficient or, you know, matter of fact. Something will come up that’s really what I was praying for, and I get that almost every time I use a praylist ... Today I did “let it go,” and it was talking about how you take up your cross, and that’s the least we can do. It was Francis, and he asked, what cross is God asking you to take up today? And all I can think of is serving that social justice piece of being anti-racist and that’s something I had never thought I would pray for. When I think of prayer I think of, you know, praise, thanks, and then asking for something, rather than praise, thanks, and asking, what are you asking of me? What is God of asking me? And that’s what Hallow has done for me -- it’s given me a space to talk, and to listen, which is  really, really special and and centering.” - @tuhtuhtayluh #HallowApp #UserSpotlight

“I went through a journey from age, 15, right until I was about 29, where I was completely far from the faith, from Christ, just living under my own terms. And, of course, a lot of things happened. I wasn't really a very happy person. I surrounded myself with people who I thought I wanted to live my life with and I didn't really want to have to respond to God's demands. It was really easy for me to do it if I kept on surrounding myself with people who weren't Christian and didn't believe in God. 
I think God was always knocking on my door, but I just kept ignoring it during all those years. And it wasn't until I was 28 or 29 that someone really close to me got really sick, was hospitalized, and was dying. I just, I didn't know what to do, so I started praying. And little by little, God started to touch my heart. I started going to Mass every day. I would go to Mass, and just, I would just feel so much love, and at the same time, I felt a lot of shame because I felt like I've been  on this really bad road for all these years. 
I was terrified of confession, until my sister convinced me to go, and then I went and it was the most beautiful, but also like terrifying, experience I had in my life. At first, I was terrified, but after reconciliation, I just understood how much I had I been missing all these years. And after that, I restarted my journey through faith.” - @daniela.ctam #HumansofHallow

Santa María de Guadalupe, Mística Rosa, intercede por la Iglesia, protege al Soberano Pontífice, oye a todos los que te invocan en sus necesidades. Así como pudiste aparecer en el Tepeyac y decirnos: "Soy la siempre Virgen María, Madre del verdadero Dios", alcánzanos de tu Divino Hijo la conservación de la Fe. Tu eres nuestra dulce esperanza en las amarguras de esta vida. Danos un amor ardiente y la gracia de la perseverancia final. Amén.

📿🙏

Blessed Virgin Mary of Guadalupe, Mystical Rose, intercede for the Church, protect the Holy Father, hear all who invoke you in their needs. Just as you were able to appear in Tepeyac and tell us: "I am Mary ever virgin, Mother of the true God", obtain for us from your Divine Son the preservation of the Faith. You are our sweet hope amidst the bitterness of this life. Give us a burning love and the grace of final perseverance. Amen.

Have you joined this month's community challenge? Beginning tomorrow, pray the Surrender Novena written by St. Padre Pio's spiritual director with the Hallow family as we complete this challenge on St. Padre Pio's feast day, September 23rd.

“Pray, hope, and don't worry. Worry is useless. God is merciful and will hear your prayer.” - St. Padre Pio

Join together with thousands of others in praying the novena throughout this month 🙏

“I like to get up early because my job has always made me a very early riser. That early morning quiet is the best time for trying to keep consistency in my faith. There would be nights where I'd get three hours of sleep, but I'd get up and it was in that moment of quiet in my room when other people were asleep, with nobody's bothering me, and I would just be quiet ... I'm still trying to discern what the Holy Spirit is calling me to in terms of a specific kind of prayer, but I've noticed my prayer is different than what I've  anticipated. 

I thought it'd be more of an active prayer life, but I feel very called toward a kind of silence, and quiet and this, you know, St. Catherine of Siena - intimate, pulled-behind-the-veil kind of prayer life - where you're not really on a mission to sit down and pray about specific things and then go attack them. 

I feel very, very moved to just really be close to God in contemplation … I definitely find myself most at peace with what God does to my life when I'm quiet, and I'm receptive to what he's trying to either say or what he's trying to communicate.” - @alex_stseb #HumansofHallow #prayer #meditation

Our next community challenge is a 54 day Rosary Novena! 📿

This novena originated in the late 19th century and is attributed to a girl in Naples, Italy who had been suffering from an illness that was thought to be incurable. After asking Mary for help, the Blessed Mother taught her this prayer and she was miraculously healed. 🙏 To this day, Catholics around the world continue to pray this novena to seek help from our Mother. For more insight into what the 54 Day novena is and how to pray it, visit http://hallow.com/54-day-novena.

We hope you’ll join us, beginning this Thursday, October 1. And together, we’ll pray as best we can, in the hope that through our prayers, we’ll grow closer to Jesus through Mary.

Join us this Thursday at 8 pm CT for an IG live Q&A with @theyoungcatholicwoman!

A conversation on prayer as a young Catholic woman.

Happy feast day to St. Faustina! St. Maria Faustina Kowalska was a Polish nun in the 1930s who was canonized in 2000. She received revelations from Jesus, instructing her to share the message of his Divine Mercy, through which all can find solace in Jesus' heart. Through her writings and the image of Jesus with the words “Jesus, I trust in You,” the Divine Mercy grew into a beautiful and popular devotion.
Pray alongside St. Faustina with the Divine Mercy Chaplet, found in dailies, or with a minute meditation on "Jesus, I trust in You."

“On a day to day, I try to wake up and be intentional about thinking of the Lord’s affections for me wrapped up in His sacred heart. From this place, I’m moved to seek Him in His word, through prayer, and through service to others. My deepest identity is that I am loved by God, and I try to live from that place everyday.

I love to invite God into my life from exercising to a funny show to a book that I’m reading. There’s a verse in Psalms that discusses how God enjoys and delights in His people (Psalm 149:4), and I truly think He wants us to just enjoy being with Him. A huge aspect of my journey of learning to just enjoy doing life with God was realizing that shame was a big barrier.

If I viewed God as the fruit of the spirit embodied — a joyful, loving Father that wants to remove the things that hurt that love — I am encouraged to draw near Him because He’s not accusing me. This has been key to bearing more fruit and feeling more connected to God during my journey.” - @ashleeeeeeyj #HumansofHallow

#HallowApp #HowToPray #theexamen #christianmeditation #catholicmeditation

“Today I was sitting next to my patient’s bedside because he’s been very sick, and he didn’t look like he was going to make it. It's hard to know what's going on sometimes in those moments of stress and the rush of a rapid response event or something. When an emergency occurs, I like to be aware of the moment, and just pause and look at that person, as a person, and try to reach my guardian angel. I totally believe guardian angels can communicate with each other, or that we can ask other people's guardian angels to watch over them and to protect and guide them. So I find myself doing that during a lot of  moments in the hospital … I always seek the guidance of my guardian angel, and honestly, that’s my prayer before I go into work. I’ll pass the hospital and do the sign of the cross and pray for the units and for the administration. 

One of the things I love about Catholicism and our faith is how you realize everyone's connected and there's a community … I was reading an old journal I came across yesterday from when I first began nursing, and it's definitely been faith that has carried me through work. Nursing definitely comes with its stressors because in the end, it is a job, and it can be a challenge in faith, but also beautiful in how it helps you grow.” - @bernalornothing #HumansofHallow

“I like to tell people that I've been going to mass since I was in the womb, and so my faith has always been such an integral part of my life. I feel like even as a young child, although I didn't fully realize or understand, I knew what faith was, but I didn't understand the true beauty and the depth of it until I was older.

I would truly say a pinnacle turning point in my faith life was when I went to LMU, and I got to go on a pilgrimage to follow in the footsteps of Saint Ignatius, and that was absolutely transformative. I mean to see where he was born, to have mass where he had his conversion was absolutely powerful, and before that trip, I always dreamed and envisioned my life being like the next Giuliana Rancic, on the red carpet, but again after listening to Saint Ignatius' story and really learning about his life, that changed. He came from a wealthy family, and he was a supposedly ladies man, and he gave all of that up. He gave all that up to serve Christ.

I just really want to make it my life's mission to help others, have faith, believe and know that it's okay to struggle with mental illness as a person of faith because God does not want us to walk on this journey alone, nor do we have to.”

Hello to all of our new followers! We are #Hallow, a Catholic Prayer & Meditation App and our mission is to help you find peace, deepen your relationship with God, and sleep soundly every night. We were started by a group of friends from @NotreDame in 2018, led by our CEO Alex Jones and quickly became an amazing team of 11 full-time employees living and working all across the country. Our team is so diverse, made up of students, moms and dads, tech wizards, marketing masters, finance gurus all with our own families, but the Hallow team has become just like a family. We want to bring people together by faith and work hard to make our app better every day.

We wanted to say thank you for following and welcome you to the Hallow fam!

Introduce yourself in the comments and tell us where you’re praying from!

“I grew up in a Catholic family. When I attended Boston College, a Catholic university, I committed my life to Christ. I discerned the priesthood, which brought me to Yale Divinity School. While there I discovered my love of entrepreneurship. After moving back to Silicon Valley, I co-founded a start-up. While I always kept my faith, I mostly spent time with non-Christians and attended non-Catholic churches. Having been inspired by a friend to go to confession after not doing so for a long time, I felt the Holy Spirit descend upon me in the absolution. That's when I recommitted to my Catholic faith.

Jesus is my constant conversation partner. I'm always praying to him. I owe everything to him: the blessings of this life and the bliss of eternity ahead of us.”

-Mike @mikedelponte #HumansofHallow

“I’m a cradle Catholic, so I have twenty-six years of Catholicism, but I had some lukewarm years in college and right after college. I started asking questions, and when you’re asking questions, you start to find answers, especially in the faith. I started kind of diving into it more, and that brought me back to rote prayers and just the basics. But I realized I didn’t really know or understand the basics that well anyways, so I stripped my faith down into: can you just pray one Our Father, one Hail Mary, and one Glory be every single day. I sometimes tried to jump in too far —or I guess too much is the best way to describe it — and then I was always set up for failure. I became over committed, and it was really difficult to dive in and do all these different things that I thought I had to do. So I realized, especially when quarantine was kind of starting up, that I can’t do all these things — I need to bring it back to the basics. And that’s where Hallow came into play.
I commute about thirty minutes every day for work, and so I started doing the Rosary on the app on my way to work. It was really, really helpful to get through them, but also, I could enter more of a meditation state instead of worrying how many Hail Marys I was saying … Then quarantine happened, so I stopped having my routine, stopped having my commute. And, you know, I had another kind of lapse of my daily prayer life, but, of course, the app came back in my life. I was like, you know what, I build this up for two months, and I was doing a rosary every single day and loving it and loving how I was feeling in my interior life, so I wanted to get back to that.”

Today we honor Our Lady of Guadalupe on her Feast Day. 🤗 Mary's appearance is a reminder that God loves and accepts everyone.

“Let not your heart be disturbed… Am I not here, who is your Mother? Are you not under my protection? Am I not your health? Are you not happily within my fold? What else do you wish? Do not grieve nor be disturbed by anything.” - Our Lady of Guadalupe to Juan Diego

📿🙏

"No se turbe tu corazón... ¿Acaso no estoy aquí yo, que soy tu madre? ¿No estás bajo mi sombra? ¿No soy tu salud? ¿No estás por ventura en mi regazo? ¿Por ventura aun tienes necesidad de cosa otra alguna? Por favor, que ya ninguna otra cosa te angustie, te perturbe..." - Nuestra Virgen de Guadalupe a Juan Diego

We are excited to release the next album of Hallow Music, 🎶 the 'O Antiphons' exclusively recorded for us by Rebekah Wu at the Holy Rosary Chapel in San Rafael, California. 🕯 Swipe for a sample from the recording!
As described by our friends at @catholiclink_en "The O Antiphons are part of the ancient and venerable tradition of the Roman Church going back to at least the eighth century, if not earlier. They are associated with Pope St. Gregory the Great. An antiphon is a short sentence that comes before or after a psalm or song in the liturgy.
The O Antiphons are part of the final days of Advent leading up to Christmas 🎄. They begin on December 17 and go through December 23 and come before and after the Magnificat during the Liturgy of the Hours Evening Prayer."
We hope that you enjoy these beautiful traditional recordings in Hallow Music 🎵 from today until December 23rd

It is hard to believe we are already a week into 2021! Whether or not you are someone who creates resolutions for each new year, I think we can all get behind a new tradition of spiritual resolutions after last year.

In our blog post on 5 Steps for Creating (and Achieving) a Spiritual Resolution in 2021, Taylor says, "The start of the year is a great time to set goals, evaluate habits, and take steps towards improving your mind and body" This is so true and it is never too late to get started!

Today we celebrate the Feast of the Baptism of Our Lord! Through Baptism, Christ manifests His humility and dedicates himself to the absolution of man. 🙏

Tomorrow is a BIG day on the Hallow App. We will be launching 7 NEW Bible Sleep Stories! 😴
Can you guess which of your favorite Catholic speakers will be reading you the Bible to fall asleep?! 💤🌙
Comment below with your guess! 👇👇

#BibleStory #Scripture #SleepStory #SleepMeditation #Gospel #Catholic #Catholicmeditation #sleep #HallowApp

Drum roll, please 🥁...
We are so excited to announce our latest batch of Bible Stories in the @hallowapp!
Throughout the day, we will be announcing all 7 in order of where the story appears in the Bible.
Our first story to announce is from none other than @jackiefrancois! Jackie is an incredible wife, mom, author, musician, and speaker, and we are so blessed to have her reading the entire Book of Ruth. 
Head over to the 'Sleep Tab' 💤 of the app to listen tonight!
“Wherever you go I will go, wherever you lodge I will lodge. Your people shall be my people and your God, my God.” (Ruth 1:15)
#BookofRuth #BibleStory #SleepStory #restwithGod #SleepMeditation #CatholicMeditation

The Psalms teach us how to pray to God in all moments of life, including praise, lament, thanksgiving, and petition. 
This new Bible Story, read by @jasonevert, features a collection of Psalms that encourage us to place hope in God. 
Jason Evert is a Catholic author, speaker, and founder of the Chastity Project, and we are grateful to have him reading these Psalms of Hope (Psalms 40-46) at a time they are most certainly needed! 🙏
“Surely, I wait for the Lord;  who bends down to me and hears my cry.” (Psalm 40:1)
#Psalms #PsalmsofHope #BibleStory #SleepStory #FallAsleeptoScripture

If you've listened to @mattfradd and @pints_w_aquinas, you will know that Matt is a big fan of @hallowapp, and we are a big fan of him! 
Now, you can listen to Matt reading the Song of Songs, a book in the Bible rich in imagery that contains several poems about two lovers in ancient Israel. 
Fall asleep tonight 💤 to a beautiful love story written by Solomon. ❤️
“Let me seek him whom my soul loves.” (Songs 3:2)
#SongofSongs #BibleStories #HallowBibleStories #SleepStory #MattFradd #Scripture #CatholicMeditaiton

A wonderful story in the Bible is that of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, a group of friends in Babylon who refused to worship an idol erected by King Nebuchadnezzar and were sentenced to be thrown into a white-hot furnace.🔥
Hallow is blessed to have @heypjk lend his voice to our Bible Stories reading this inspiring story of determination and strength💪 from the Book of Daniel. 
Paul J. Kim is a singer, speaker, and author who lives in Texas with his wife and four children. Listen to his Bible Story tonight!
“They walked about in the flames, singing to God and blessing the Lord. Azariah stood up in the midst of the fire and prayed aloud.” (Daniel 3:24-25)
#BibleStory #BookofDaniel #SleepStory #CatholicMeditation #sleepsoundly #scripture

Our Bible Stories now move on to the New Testament, where we begin with @bobby.angel reading the story of Lazarus from the Gospel of John. ✝️
We are so excited to have BOTH Bobby and his wife @jackiefrancois read a Bible Story on the app. 
Bobby Angel is a Catholic writer and teacher, and has served as a presenter for popular programs, such as “Ascension Presents.” Both Jackie and Bobby are now Fellows of the @wordonfire_catholicministries!
Find peace with this Bible Story tonight! 🙏
“Jesus told her, “I am the resurrection and the life; whoever believes in me, even if he dies, will live.” (John 11:25)
#BibleStory #GospelofJohn #Lazarus #JesusItrustinYou #SleepStory #NewTestament #CatholicMeditation

Our final Bible Story to announce tonight also comes from the Gospel of John, but a few chapters later. We are blessed to have another @catholicfaithformation speaker, @frjoshjohnson reading from The Last Supper narrative according to John. 🥖🍷
Fr. Josh Johnson is the pastor of Our Lady of the Holy Rosary Church in the Diocese of Baton Rouge, a podcast host, and author. 
 
It might take you several days to get through all of these amazing new stories with incredible speakers, authors, musicians, and people. We at @hallowapp are so grateful for the time and talent that each person lent to the app so that you could find peace and grow closer to God through His Word. ✝️
Good night and peace be with you 🙏

The Hallow #Pray40 Challenge for Lent this year starts in 7 days! Have you joined the waitlist yet? 🙏 This Lent, we are inviting you to find peace in your relationship with God by joining the challenge and committing to daily prayer.

In the challenge, there are 40 days of Lenten meditations and in honor of Pope Francis naming 2021, the "Year of St. Joseph," we have built the #Pray40 community around growing in the virtues of the patron the Universal Church. These virtues include: humility, hiddenness, obedience, chastity, justice and love of the poor. 💜

Open the app and scroll down on the Home tab to join the waitlist today!

#prayerlife #lent #pray40 #prayerchangesthings #jesusdaily #trustjesus #trustgod #trustinhim #jesusitrustinyou #meditate

Each day this week, we will highlight a different type of meditation that is featured in the Lent #Pray40 Challenge. 🙌

For Day 1, we have prayers to grow in humility and obedience. On Ash Wednesday we will be praying the Litany of Humility.

We have two more meditations following this theme... can you guess which they will be?

Put your best guess in the comments below! ⬇️

#prayerlife #lent #pray40 #prayerchangesthings #jesusdaily #trustjesus #trustgod #trustinhim #jesusitrustinyou #meditate

For Day 2 of our #Pray40 Challenge highlight, we have The Seven Sorrows Rosary. 📿 We will pray this rosary a few times over the course of the challenge.

The Rosary of the Seven Sorrows gained popularity following the Marian apparitions in Kibeho, Rwanda in the 1980s. During Mary’s apparitions to Marie-Claire Mukangango, she assigned the young woman a mission to reintroduce this special Rosary to the world.

For more information on this rosary and how to pray it, please visit our blog here: https://hallow.com/2021/02/10/7-sorrows/

#prayerlife #lent #pray40 #prayerchangesthings #jesusdaily #trustjesus #trustgod #trustinhim #jesusitrustinyou #meditate

We are less than one week from the beginning of Lent! For Day 3 of our #Pray40 Challenge highlight, we take a look at Examinations of Conscience. 🤔 

There are three ways to pray that follow along with this theme! One of them is the Beatitudes - eight blessings that were recounted by Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew. 📖 

Each beatitude begins with "blessed are..." and teaches us that we are blessed even in times of hardship.

Which beatitude do you hold on to when things are hard?

Journey through the eyes of St. Joseph this Lent during the #Pray40 challenge! In honor of the Year of St. Joseph, we're going through this journey with him as our guide. 🤍

For Day 4 of our challenge highlight, we have the Litany of St. Joseph! 🙏

We have a number of other meditations in honor of St. Joseph during the challenge! We hope you will join us in praying this lent. 🤗🤗

The beginning of Lent will look a lot different this year. In January, the Vatican announced modifications to the distribution of ashes on Ash Wednesday, replacing the usual application of an ash cross by a thumb with a "sprinkling" of ashes on the head.

This year, with many churches providing limited services and with many people still quarantining, there will be a large number of Christians who will be unable to receive ashes and even more who will not have the opportunity to publicly embrace their penance.

In response, Hallow is proud to announce the launch of a digital "AshTag" effect on both Facebook and Instagram.

Check out our linkinbio for the link to the Ashes on Facebook and Instagram! 

To post your digital ashes, simply click either of the links above, take a selfie, and the AshTag effect will automatically be applied to your forehead. Don’t forget to add the hashtag “#ashtag2021” and tag @hallowapp!

To learn more about what ashes symbolize in the church and the #AshTag, please visit out blog post

Remember You are Dust and to Dust You Shall Return

Today is the day we kick off the 40 days of Lent and begin the season of preparing our hearts for the most important event in human history: Christ’s death and resurrection.

We’re so excited and grateful to pray with you as we begin today with the first session of the St. Joseph #Pray40 Challenge: the Litany of Humility.

We have a ton of great content coming to you during the #Pray40 challenge and we hope that you will enjoy it! 

For Lent this year, don't just give up your phone, but use it as a way to grow closer to God. Head on over to the app, join the challenge, and be sure to try out the #ashtag2021 filter.

We are all praying for you here at Hallow and hope you have a blessed Lent 🙏

Did you know that March is National Sleep Awareness month?! The Hallow App has so many tools to help you fall asleep and stay asleep, resting peacefully with God 💤
Here are a few suggestions of meditations in the app to help you sleep:
📖 Bible Stories (many of which are read by some of your favorite Catholic speakers, with potentially more to come this month 😉)
🌜Night Prayer from the Liturgy of the Hours
📜Sleep Lectio to fall asleep meditating on Scripture
✝️ Sleep Examen to reflect on your day prayerfully
All of these and more can be found on the 'Sleep' Tab of the app. Comment below 👇 with your favorite Hallow meditation to fall asleep with!
Worried you shouldn't fall asleep while praying? Even St. Therese of Lisieux wasn't worried when she reflected on falling asleep after Holy Communion 
"I think how little children please their parents just as much when they are asleep as when they are awake; I think how doctors put patients to sleep in order to do operations. And finally, I think how “the Lord sees our weakness, he remembers that we are but dust”

"...Holy Mary, pray for us.
Saint Joseph, pray for us.
Noble son of the House of David, pray for us.
Light of patriarchs, pray for us.
Husband of the Mother of God, pray for us..." 🙏
As part of the #Pray40 Challenge, each Thursday in the first four weeks of Lent, we pray the Litany of Saint Joseph, a beautiful devotion to the Patron of the Universal Church.

Pope Francis has declared this year to be the year of Saint Joseph and we honor him with this petition. Because of this, each day you say the Litany of St. Joseph, you may receive a plenary indulgence, which may be earned once a day, subject to the usual conditions: sacramental confession, reception of Holy Communion, prayer for the intentions of the Pope, and a total detachment to all sin, including venial sin.
We continue to pray for you this Lent ✝️

#Lent #SaintJoseph #YearofSaintJoseph #Litany

“Thank you, women who are wives! You irrevocably join your future to that of your husbands, in a relationship of mutual giving, at the service of love and life. Thank you, women who are daughters and women who are sisters! Into the heart of the family, and then of all society, you bring the richness of your sensitivity, your intuitiveness, your generosity and fidelity. Thank you, women who work! You are present and active in every area of life-social, economic, cultural, artistic and political. In this way you make an indispensable contribution to the growth of a culture which unites reason and feeling, to a model of life ever open to the sense of "mystery", to the establishment of economic and political structures ever more worthy of humanity. Thank you, every woman, for the simple fact of being a woman! Through the insight which is so much a part of your womanhood you enrich the world's understanding and help to make human relations more honest and authentic.” 
- St. John Paul II

On this #Internationalwomensday, we celebrate women and all the ways in which they bring Christ’s love to the world ✝️❤️. 

Take some time today to pray with some of our favorite women saints that you'll find in Hallow! Pray with Mary with the Rosary, 7 Sorrows, or Minute Mary prayers, or pray with our Saint Challenge and Minute Saint prayers alongside St. Teresa of Avila, St. Catherine of Sienna, and St. Teresa of Calcutta. At Hallow, we pray for all women today 🙏

Today's #TipTuesday is from Abby, our Head of Content ✍️! Abby is also the female voice on Hallow. 

To make silent prayer 🙏 a little less intimidating, Abby likes to use Hallow's Prayer Timer ⏲️ (found under "Dailies" on the Hallow App) with light piano 🎹 in the background. 

Abby's tip: as you pray, sit before a crucifix or write in a journal, and let God lead you!

Happy St. Patrick's Day! 🍀

St. Patrick is one of the most well-known Saints given the popularity of his official feast day, which began to be celebrated in the 17th century. 🇮🇪

St. Patrick actually began his time in Ireland as a slave, and after being freed, returned to Ireland to preach the Gospel. He often used shamrocks to explain the Holy Trinity and entire kingdoms were eventually converted to Christianity after hearing his message. ☘️

Saint Patrick is the Patron Saint of Engineers, Ireland, and Nigeria. 

You can visit the Saints Challenge in the Hallow App to meditate on the lives and writings of some of Christianity's other famous saints today!

On Tuesday, we began our journey through the Stations of the Cross in the Lent #Pray40 Challenge with The First Station: Condemned to Die.

Today is the Solemnity of Saint Joseph! St. Joseph was the husband of the Blessed Virgin Mary and the earthly father of Jesus. 

Solemnities, which are different from Feast Days, are the celebrations of greatest importance in the Liturgical calendar. Pope Francis declared this year to be the year of St. Joseph, so we have even more to celebrate today 🎉

On Solemnities in the Church, we should not be doing acts of voluntary penance. Today, instead of your Friday and Lenten fasts, take some time to learn more about Saint Joseph or pray the Litany of St. Joseph in the Hallow App!

Do you have a special devotion to St. Joseph? Share it with us in the comments ⬇️

Today's #TipTuesday comes from our #Pray40: St. Joseph Challenge🙏. In today's meditation, we are reminded of Psalm 37. 

"Though we stumble, we shall not fall headlong, for the Lord holds us by the hand."

Before you pray today, consider these 3 reminders to embrace God holding you by the hand👋:

1️⃣ Find a place to pray 
2️⃣ Quiet your heart & mind
3️⃣ Rest with God

As you might know, Jonathan has a devotion to the Divine Mercy, and has often prayed the Chaplet live on his social media. 📿

For this event, we will be talking about the history of the Divine Mercy devotion, why Jonathan is so drawn to the Divine Mercy Chaplet, what Divine Mercy has meant in his life, and praying the chaplet together prior to the start of the Triduum and the Divine Mercy Novena on Good Friday. ✝️

Mark your calendars for 9 PM EST live only on Instagram (sorry no Facebook live this time).

“Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord. Peace in heaven and glory in the highest.” - Luke 19:38

As we go through Palm Sunday, we meditate on Jesus' entrance into Jerusalem. In the Hallow App, we encourage you to listen to the Daily Gospel Lectio Divina, where we'll pray with the Gospel passage that is read before mass during the procession of the psalms.

If you are able to attend mass this Palm Sunday, you will receive your palms. If you are not able to attend in-person masses, you can also make you own! Search "printable palms for Palm Sunday" for inspiration 🌴

Then check our your Hallow App this Friday for the release of our Divine Mercy Novena which will run through April 11th! 🙏

After a difficult time in Europe in 1931, Sister Faustina, a Polish nun, received a visit from Jesus who asked her to paint a picture representing his divine love and spread the message of divine mercy around the world. 💜 Jesus then instructed Sister Faustina to encourage everyone to say the Chaplet that he revealed to her.

The Divine Mercy Novena is intended to be prayed beginning on Good Friday and ending on the Saturday before Divine Mercy Sunday.

#DivineMercy #DivineMercyChaplet #DivineMercyNovena #HolyWeek #GoodFriday #JonathanRoumie

Today marks the beginning of the Paschal Triduum - the three days that beginning with the liturgy on the evening of Holy Thursday reaching its peak during the Easter Vigil. 😇

The mass on Thursday is the Mass of the Lord's Supper, celebrating the last meal Jesus had with his disciples and the establishment of the Eucharist.

If you are able to attend in-person mass for Holy Thursday, we encourage you to! If you are unable, please click the link in our bio and read our blog post on "Holy Week Resources" for ways to celebrate today at home. 🏠

In the Hallow App, we have several options for prayer on Holy Thursday that you can find on the Home tab.

#Lent #HolyWeek #YearofSaintJoseph #christianmeditation #catholicmeditation #prayerlife #prayergoals #Triduum #HolyThursday

Traditionally, Good Friday is a day where masses are not celebrated and the Eucharist is not distributed.

It is a solemn day where we are encouraged to fast, pray, and venerate the cross where Christ gave up His last breath to offer us eternal life.

Some churches will be open for Stations of the Cross or a service but if you are unable to attend, please click the link in our bio and read our blog post on "Holy Week Resources" for ways to participate at home.

In the Hallow App, we will begin the Divine Mercy Novena on Good Friday leading up to Divine Mercy Sunday. This novena is being led in the app by @jonathanroumieofficial 💜

There is nothing more man needs than Divine Mercy – that love which is benevolent, which is compassionate, which raises man above his weakness to the infinite heights to the holiness of God."

Thank you for journeying with us through the Divine Mercy Novena with @jonathanroumieofficial. We pray that you are blessed with God's infinite love that is His Divine Mercy today and always. ✝️❤️🙏

May is Mental Health Awareness Month! 👤

Hallow is proud to participate by supporting our community in strengthening their mental health. God calls us to share our gifts and talents with the world, and the best way to do that is by starting from a position of strong spiritual and mental health.

Over the next few weeks, we are excited to share different prayer techniques and habits that we believe will help contribute to your goal of strengthening your own mental health through a personal relationship with God. 🙏

Please click on the link in our bio for a blog post on Mental Health Awareness Month for more information!

Today is the feast day of Our Lady of Fatima!

In the Hallow App as part of Easter with the Saints, you can pray with a beautiful prayer given to the children at Fatima.

Just go to Meditate --> Dailies --> Daily Saint

To celebrate Pentecost, our next challenge is the Holy Spirit Novena! 🕊️ The Holy Spirit Novena is considered the first novena, because it commemorates the nine days between the Ascension of Christ and the descent of the Holy Spirit on the Church. ⛪

We are so excited that @chikasworld, a Catholic speaker and writer, who you know from our Bible Stories, will be leading us in the novena.

The challenge begins today and will end Sunday, May 22, the vigil of Pentecost!

The theme for this year's Mental Health Awareness Month is "Tools2Thrive".

To go along with that theme, we are excited to share suggestions of different types of prayer that can support a strong spiritual practice and a healthy mental state.

The first Tool we have to share is Lectio Divina. This translates to divine reading. 📖 By rooting our prayer in God's word, we can take comfort in knowing that He accompanies us on any journey we take. 👣

Please click on the link in our bio for a blog post on Drawing Comfort from Scripture for more information!

Our latest round of Bible Stories releases today and features four of your favorite Catholic speakers and authors!

The first story we have to share is a reading from the First Letter of St. John, where it is written, “God is Love.” 🙏

God Is Love is read by @frrobgalea, a Catholic musician, speaker, and founder of FRG Ministry. He adds his second Bible Story to the app with this moving reading.

We hope that this reading will give you comfort and peace tonight. 🕊️

#GodIsLove #music #CatholicSpeaker #CatholicMediation #FRGMinistry #Hallow #HallowApp #BibleStory #sleep #love

This next Bible Story contains a piece of Scripture that helps us persevere in hard times. 👣

@katieprejeanmcgrady, a Catholic speaker, author, and radio host, reads the Letter of James, a powerful letter on discipleship from the New Testament.

The next technique we have to share for #mentalhealthawarenessmonth is Praying with the Saints.

Praying with the Saints, and asking Saints to pray for us, reminds us that we are not alone in our struggles. You can always turn to a Saint to ask for prayers and look for inspiration and guidance on how to grow closer to God. 🙏

Please click on the link in our bio for our latest blog post on Praying with Saints!

Pope Francis had a General Audience on April 28th on a topic close to us here at Hallow: meditation. We are sharing three key takeaways that are applicable to your prayer life and time spent in meditation with the Hallow App. ⬇️

The third technique we have to share for #mentalhealthawareness month that we believe will help contribute to strengthening your mental health and a personal relationship with God is the Examen. 

In praying the Examen, we are invited to reflect on our day and identify where we experienced God.

St. Ignatius believed that the Examen was a gift from God to be shared as widely as possible.

If you're ready to try the Examen, you can find it in the Hallow app under "Dailies" 🙌

May is #mentalhealthawarenessmonth and on this final day of May, we are sharing our last prayer technique for mental health: Community and Family Prayer.

This Memorial Day, we focus on offering prayers of thanksgiving for our friends and family who have made great personal sacrifice to defend our freedom and safety.

Embracing an attitude of gratitude for those serving our communities is beneficial for both our mental and spiritual health 👪 We believe prayer helps build a strong personal relationship with God and that praying with and for others is an important practice that accepts God's grace into the life of the person praying and the person prayed for. 

We courage everyone to offer special prayers this Memorial Day for the families of those service men and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice and that are no longer with us 🙏

Today is the Immaculate Heart of Mary Solemnity. To celebrate, we wanted to give everyone more information on the new 7 Sorrows Rosary in the Hallow App! 📿

The 7 Sorrows Rosary leads us through the sorrows of Christ's life. It dates back to the fourteenth century when Mary, Our Lady of Sorrows, appeared to St. Bridget of Sweden and revealed this Rosary devotion to her.

We pray this to learn to suffer with love as Mary did. ❤️

In the Gospel of John, St. John the Baptist is quoted saying to his followers that Jesus is the Lamb of God. 🐑

In the Hallow App, you can meditate on the words of St. John the Baptist in many ways!

We recommend:

😴 In the Beginning - Narrated by @fathermikeschmitz, you can fall asleep to this Bible Story as you listen to the Gospel of John, chapter 1.

🎶 Ut Queant Laxis - Found in Hallow Music, this chant was written for the feast of St. John the Baptist and is sung by Schola Antiqua.

🙏 Daily Saint - Continue to meditate with our Daily Saints praylist featuring St. John the Baptist today!

Happy Friday! As we head into the weekend, we are sharing 3 #placestopray outside this summer! 🏖🌴🌅

1️⃣ Among flowers 🌸

You might live near a field of wildflowers, or your neighbors might have some beautiful flowers planted in their yards. Regardless of where you see flowers in your everyday, try praying among flowers this summer! We even have a meditation to guide your time in prayer among flowers. Check out the Calm Praylist > Consider the lillies. 

2️⃣ On a walk🚶

Sometimes sitting still just doesn’t work for us. We get it, and so did Saint Augustine! If you’re looking for something new in your prayer life, try taking your prayer time for a walk. We recommend starting your prayer walk with the Rosary or the Daily Gospel and then listening to the #HallowSummerPraylist.

3️⃣ Near water 🌊

Being near water can bring a renewed sense of calm and peace to your day. We recommend praying near water in the morning or evening with the “A tree planted by water” Lectio Divina prayer in the app. You can find it in the Hallow Hope Praylist! 

#prayoutside #hallowapp #christianmeditation #catholicmeditation #catholicprayerapp #prayerchangesthings

Today we celebrate the Solemnity of Saints Peter and Paul 🙌 Do you know why these two saints are celebrated together? 🤔

😇 Today is the feast day of Saints Zelie and Louis Martin. Zelie and Louis were the first married couple to be canonized together 💜 — in 2015 by Pope Francis. 

We celebrate their love for one another, their children, and for God, despite the many challenges they endured together. All of the Martin children entered religious life, including their daughter and church doctor St. Therese of Lisieux (the Little Flower). 

At Hallow, we are inspired by their devotion to walking with Christ and embracing the vocations God called them to — in marriage, family life, their lace-making business, and beyond. 🙏

✝️ St. Therese of Lisieux said, “God gave me a mother and father more worthy of heaven than of earth.” 

It’s never too late to start your walk with Christ. The 30-Day Gospel Challenge is a great way to start, or renew, your faith journey. Are you ready? Let us know in the comments!👇

Today we’re sharing 3️⃣ prayers for anxiety — from three of our favorite Saints at Hallow!

We know prayer isn’t a standalone solution in supporting and strengthening mental health. This being said, we hope that these saint prayers for anxiety provide you comfort today. 💜 And, we hope they remind you that you are never alone — God and His army of Saints are always with you. 

1️⃣ St. Ignatius of Loyola

“Take, Lord, and receive all my liberty …”

This prayer reminds us that God gave us everything, and it is to Him that we can return it all. ↩️

2️⃣ St. Catherine of Siena

“Holy Spirit, come into my heart …”

When we are at a loss for words, we can always call on the Holy Spirit.🕊

3️⃣ St. Francis de Sales

“Be at peace.”

St. Francis de Sales helps us remember that God is with us today, and He will be with us tomorrow, too. 🙏

“Take, Lord and receive all my liberty.” -St. Ignatius 🙏

We love this Surrender Prayer (“Suscipe” in Latin) from St. Ignatius — it reminds us to slow down and give everything to God. 

“Everything is Yours do with it what You will.” 

This is a great prayer for …

🌅 The morning right when you wake up
🛌 At night before bed
✝️ At times when you’re struggling to trust God

You can locate the Surrender Prayer in Hallow by visiting the Meditate tab > Saints Challenge > “Surrender.”

How do you surrender each day to God? Let us know in the comments👇

Have you ever prayed the Examen?🙏 It’s a reflective prayer that helps us notice God’s presence throughout the day.

This method of prayer comes from St. Ignatius, whose feast day we celebrate tomorrow! It’s actually been 500 years since St. Ignatius started writing ✍️ the Spiritual Exercises (origin of the Examen). We’re living in an Ignatian year! 

In Hallow, you can pray the Examen every day — it’s an especially great way to check in with God throughout the day or before sleep. 

We hope you enjoyed this minute in prayer with us. How did it make you feel? Let us know👇

P.S. New Ignatian Spirituality content is coming to Hallow 👀

Gospel Challenge Check-in Day 22 🙏

“Is it lawful for us to pay tribute to Caesar or not?” Recognizing their craftiness he said to them, “Show me a denarius; whose image and name does it bear?” They replied, “Caesar’s.” So he said to them, “Then repay to Caesar what belongs to Caesar and to God what belongs to God.” They were unable to trap him by something he might say before the people, and so amazed were they at his reply that they fell silent. (Luke 20:22-26)

“I am the living bread that came down from heaven; whoever eats this bread will live forever; and the bread that I will give is my flesh for the life of the world.” John 6:51

Today's reading in the 30-Day Gospel Challenge with @jonathanroumieofficial contains The Bread of Life Discourse, one of the most powerful teachings of the Catholic faith. Coincidentally, we are also going through The Bread of Life Discourse during mass the last two weeks and for the next three weeks. 

This powerful teaching from Christ reminds us that He is the bread of life and we can not be satisfied spiritually unless we know Him.

Beginning on the Feast of the Transfiguration (today), pray with us for 9️⃣ days leading up to the Solemnity of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary (August 14th). 🕊

“Virgin Mary, Mother of fair love, Mother who never refuses to come to the aid of a child in need, Mother whose hands never cease to serve your beloved children because they are moved by the divine love and immense mercy that exists in your heart, cast your compassionate eyes upon me and see the snarl of knots that exist in my life.”

The Undoer of Knots Novena is for everyone. We all have knots in our lives — we pray this novena to Mary for her guidance and support to untangle them.

Today is the feast of St. Edith Stein! St. Edith Stein was a philosopher, Catholic convert, Carmelite nun, and martyr. 📖

She is a powerful example of intelligence and resiliency! Stein pursued higher education and faced discrimination because she was a woman and Jewish. In her 30's she discovered the works of St. Teresa of Avila and was driven to convert. She then took the name Teresa Benedicta of the Cross and continued to teach and study the works of the mystics. 🙏

Prayer for back to school - a Students' Prayer from St. Thomas Aquinas ✏️🏫🍎
"Creator of all things,
true Source of light and wisdom,
lofty origin of all being,
graciously let a ray of Your brilliance
penetrate into the darkness of my understanding
and take from me the double darkness
in which I have been born,
an obscurity of both sin and ignorance.
Give me a sharp sense of understanding,
a retentive memory,
and the ability to grasp things correctly and fundamentally.
Grant me the talent of being exact in my explanations,
and the ability to express myself with thoroughness and charm.
Point out the beginning,
direct the progress,
and help in completion;
through Christ our Lord.
Amen."

As the summer comes to a close and we head into the school year, we wanted to send students forth with a prayer. 🙏

Today we celebrate the feast day of St. Maximillian Kolbe!

St. Kolbe had a strong connection to the Virgin Mary. She is said to have appeared to him in a dream holding two crowns, one white, one red. 👑  In the dream, she asked if Kolbe was willing to accept either crown, the white for perseverance in purity and the red for martyrdom. Kolbe replied "both"

"Hail, Holy Queen, Mother of Mercy..."

Yesterday was the final day of the Mary, Undoer of Knots Novena in honor of the Solemnity of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary.

Today marks the holy occasion of the Virgin Mary’s bodily ascent to heaven at the end of her life. The Assumption is a Holy Day of Obligation. ⛪️

Word of the Assumption can be found going back to the sixth century. The feast has been celebrated under many different names, such as Commemoration, Dormition, Passing, Assumption, and today it is celebrated as a Solemnity.

Mary lived her life with full faith and trust in God and has led others to recognize His holiness.

Today we celebrate the feast day of Saint Teresa of Calcutta!

Otherwise known as Mother Teresa, this woman has been recognized throughout the world for her work with those less fortunate.

Born Agnes Bojaxhiu to Albanian parents in Macedonia, it was during her years in public school when she showed an interest in foreign missions. This led her down a path to eventually be sent to the Loreto novitiate in Darjeeling, India. Here she chose the name Teresa.

Sister Teresa was assigned to a high school for girls in Calcutta where she taught history and geography to children of the wealthy but she couldn't help but notice the poverty and suffering around her.

In 1946, Sister Teresa heard what she explained to be “a call within a call" and decided to leave the convent and help the poor while living among them. 🕊️

Padre Pio was the first priest to bear the stigmata, otherwise known as the wounds of Christ's passion. In 1918, as he was making his Thanksgiving after Mass, he had a vision of Jesus. When that vision ended, the stigmata appeared in his hands, feet, and side.

After this, many people began to come see him and he saw Jesus in all of the sick and suffering. You can pray to Padre Pio when you need help in hard times and for healing.

Padre Pio has also famously said “Pray, hope, and don't worry”. He briefly had a spiritual director, Father Don Dolindo Ruotolo, who authored the Surrender Novena, a prayer for surrendering yourself and letting Jesus take care of everything. #surrendernovena #communitychallegne

To learn more about Padre Pio, head to the Daily Saint section of the Hallow App 🙏

Do you have something on your heart? Someone you really want to pray for?

Join us in a 54 Day Rosary novena beginning this Friday, October 1! 📿 This novena originated in the late 19th century and is attributed to a girl in Naples, Italy, who had been suffering from an illness that was thought to be incurable. After asking Mary for help, the Blessed Mother taught her this prayer and she was miraculously healed.

Catholics around the world continue to pray this novena to seek help from our Mother.

Happy Feast Day to St. Francis of Assisi! St. Francis is the patron saint of Italy 🇮🇹 and ecology 🌎. He founded the Franciscan Order, which values the simplicity of life in prayer 🙏 and poverty. His life reminds us to treasure the beauty of God’s creation and to return to simplicity often. We love his prayer to God for our vocation to sow peace and love in this life: 

“Lord, make me an instrument of your peace.
Where there is hatred, let me sow love;
Where there is doubt, faith; 
Where there is despair, hope; 
Where there is darkness, light; 
And where there is sadness, joy.” 

💜 To spend more time with St. Francis of Assisi, pray with today’s Daily Saint or the full “Lord, make me an instrument” prayer (found in the Saints Challenge) on Hallow!

Join us as we begin nine days of prayer with Hallow's patron saint, St. Teresa of Avila! 🔥

St. Teresa was a Carmelite nun in Spain and had a great relationship with God. Both the Virgin Mary and Jesus appeared to her in prayer! She often wrote about her experiences and has been a guide for many due to her powerful writings.

Together, let's seek to learn from her example of holiness. 🙏 You can find this novena on the home page of the Hallow App under "More Novenas"

Have you started the latest section of Bible in a Year? We have completed the section on the Return and have moved on to the Maccabean Revolt period.

Need a refresher on this period? The Maccabean Revolt was a Jewish rebellion against the Seleucid ruler Antiochus IV who ordered the religious persecution of the Jews in Judea. This rebellion was originally led by priest named Mattathias and his followers who became known as Maccabees.

Today is the feast of St. Teresa of Avila! Join us as we celebrate 🙌

St. Teresa of Avila is Hallow’s patron saint. Here at Hallow, we admire her courageousness to let her spiritual contemplation drive her sense of being in the world — teaching us that each of our souls has an “interior castle” to draw into as we grow closer to God.

She is a wonderful Saint to lean on if you’re looking to grow closer to God through Christian meditation. She’s also one of the four female Doctors of the Church! ⛪

Do you have a patron saint for your organization or a saint you call on whenever you need support? Let us know in the comments!

#54DayNovenaCheckIn

How is everyone? We are on Day 16 of the 54-Day Novena. Today is a Rosary highlighting the joyful mysteries. 🤗

Each of the five decades of the Rosary highlights a mystery from the life of Jesus. You may be used to seeing four sets of mysteries, each containing five pivotal moments from the life of Jesus — including the Joyful, Sorrowful, Luminous, and Glorious mysteries. The Luminous mysteries weren’t around when the 54 Day Novena started — though you certainly can include them if you’d like! 📿

When praying the Rosary, we enter into one set of mysteries at a time, walking with Mary and Jesus as we meditate on the depths of God’s love for us. 

The Joyful mysteries invite us to enter into the wonder of Jesus coming to earth as a baby. We see through Mary’s eyes the incredible story unfold – the angel appear (The Annunciation), her cousin Elizabeth’s reaction (The Visitation), the birth of her son (The Nativity), and the incredible events that point to who this child is and what he will do (The Presentation and Finding in the Temple). We are invited to do as Mary did and “ reflecting on them in [our] heart[s]” (Luke 2:19). 💜

To learn more about the mysteries, please click the link in our bio and read our "How to Pray: The Rosary" blog.

Today is the Feast Day of St. Luke the Evangelist, a companion of St. Paul, and author of the Gospel of Luke and the Book of Acts.
To honor this significant Saint's feast day, take a listen on Hallow to one of the meditations from the Gospel of Luke with @jonathanroumieofficial, a Bible Story from Acts with @emwilss, or the Daily Saint meditation on his life. 
Saint Luke, pray for us 🙏

Today is the first day of the St. Jude Novena on Hallow💜! Over these next 9️⃣ days, we will ask St. Jude🔥, who is the patron saint of impossible causes and desperate situations, to guide us in prayer. We’re so excited to share that Scott Hahn (@scottwhahn) will be leading us through this novena. 

🙏 “St. Jude, you are the patron of the impossible. Pray for me and my intentions! O St. Jude, pray that God’s grace and mercy will cover my intentions. Pray for the impossible if it is God’s will.”

This novena was written by @praymorenovenas, and you can find it on the “Challenges” tab of the Hallow App! We look forward to praying with you.

Saint John Paul II is a favorite here at Hallow! As a modern Saint, there is so much we can learn from his teachings and his life. At the forefront of his ministry was love, love for God and love for each other. We pray that you may experience that love more fully today. 
Saint John Paul II, pray for us 🙏
P.S. stay tuned for some really amazing content from this great Saint. In the meantime, tune into today's Daily Saint meditation, now free for everyone!

Simon (the Zealot) and Jude (known as Thaddaeus) were apostles of Jesus. 
We have been praying the St. Jude Novena with @scottwhahn from the @stpaulcenter for the last 9 days, asking him to help us in our most desperate situations.

We are so excited to share our newest guest session with @madiprew called Standing Firm. In this 6 part session, Madi guides us through scripture and reflections on identity, standing firm under pressure, and growing in confidence. 
Madi left Season 24 of The Bachelor due to misalignments with her Christian values as well as her commitment to chastity. We are inspired by her conviction to stand firm under pressure and live in her faith, a message both Catholics and non-Catholic Christians can support. 
Check out her sessions and scriptural affirmations on the Guests tab. Also check out the YouTube interview Madi did with @jonathanroumieofficial (link in bio).

"When we first started Hallow, we had no idea what would happen. Every month that goes by, we are blown away by the impact that God has been able to have on so many lives so quickly. Today, I am humbled to share that we’ve raised $40m in new funding to help create more content, build a better app, and help more folks to find peace in God.

The past few months have been crazy - folks on the app have completed over 25m prayers, we’ve passed 1m downloads, added 20 great new folks to the team, brought together a phenomenal new advisory board, and added some amazing new content from inspirational faith leaders around the world.

With this latest round, we’re blessed to partner with some amazing new investors - Drive Capital, Peter Thiel, Teamworthy Ventures, Narya VC, Uncork Capital, Susa Ventures, Contrary Capital, General Catalyst, Jim Perry, and Scott Malpass - in helping to bring the Hallow mission of prayer to the world, especially to those who may have fallen away from their faith.

God has us on a crazy ride. Couldn’t be more excited to see where He takes it."

#54DayNovenaCheckIn

How is everyone doing? We are on Day 36 of the 54-Day Novena. The session today focuses on the Glorious mysteries.🙌 

In the Glorious mysteries, we meditate on the awe-inspiring, hard-to-wrap-your-brain-around miracles that took place after Jesus’ death. We experience the joy of the risen Christ, imagining ourselves as Mary or the first disciples (The Resurrection). As we pray, we see Jesus’ Ascension into heaven and send the Holy Spirit at Pentecost. The last two mysteries are the only two that are not explicitly mentioned in Scripture but rather come from hundreds of years of tradition based on passages from Revelation and Song of Songs. In these last two mysteries, we celebrate that where Mary – who Jesus has given us to be our mother – goes, we too hope to go one day (The Assumption and Coronation of Mary).🌹

To learn more about the mysteries, please click the link in our bio and read our "How to Pray: The Rosary" blog.

The Daily Gospel Readings on Hallow have been one of our most popular sessions every day since we launched. 🚀 The one piece of feedback we have heard repeatedly was to add a Daily Gospel Reflection to hear commentary from a Scripture scholar in addition to the reading of the passage itself.

We knew this was something we had to get right - helping folks interpret the Word of God isn’t something to take lightly, and we wanted it to be led by someone who was both extremely qualified, and relatable. 🙌

Today, we couldn’t be more excited to share that we are launching a brand new Daily Reflection and that it will be led by Jeff Cavins (@jeffcavins). Jeff is the author of the best-selling Catholic Bible Study in the world & is the guide behind Fr. Mike Schmitz’s Bible in a Year. Each day he’ll be sharing with us his personal reflections on the Daily Gospel, as narrated by our very own Jonathan Roumie (@jonathanroumieofficial).

It just so happens that today, this first day of the launch, is also Jeff’s birthday! We pray you’ll join us in listening through Jeff’s powerful reflections in the app and in wishing him a happy birthday! 🎉

Congratulations on completing another section of Bible in a Year with @fathermikeschmitz. It is crazy to believe we have completed over 300 days. 🙌

Now that we have finished the Maccabean Revolt, we move on to the Gospel of Luke. 📖 This is our last "Messianic Checkpoint" and the second to last section as we continue on our Bible in a Year journey.

Don't worry if you have fallen behind! We will continue to have the Bible in a Year available for you in the new year and if you haven't started yet, we couldn't recommend it more!!

Fun fact, the symbol of Luke's Gospel is an ox 🐂. Do you know why? Let us know in the comments! (Hint: It has to do with sacrifice.)

#BIY #FatherMike #Ascension #Return #Gospel #Bible #Catholic #HallowApp #JesusDaily #Prayeveryday #Readthebible #ascension

In addition to the Daily Gospel Readings on Hallow, we also have Daily Mass Readings. 📖

Listen to Anna, one of Hallow's newest Guides as we pray the daily Mass readings together. Today's Mass includes readings from the Book of Wisdom, Gospel of Luke, and Psalms.

All readings come from the NRSV-CE translation, which is approved by the Church for personal devotion, but is not the official liturgical translation!

Hallow is proud to announce our Advent collaboration with Mary's Meals USA (@marysmealsusa).

🚨 For every person that joins the #Pray25 Challenge by December 3 we will donate $1 to feed children at schools in Liberia. $1 is the equivalent of 10 meals for a child (for $21 we can feed a child for an entire year, so invite 20 friends!).

@marysmeals sets up community-run school feeding projects in some of the world's poorest communities to provide one daily meal in a place of learning that attracts chronically poor children into the classroom, where they receive an education that can be their ladder out of poverty. 🙏 

This Advent, as we journey with Mary in the #Pray25 Challenge, join us to provide a daily meal for thousands of children through Mary's Meals.

P.S. we are already at >23k in the challenge, that's $23,000 already!!!

#54DayNovena check in!

We are on day 47 of the 54-Day Novena challenge. In the final eight days, let us thank God as we pray together in thanksgiving.

The session today focuses on the Sorrowful mysteries. The Sorrowful mysteries help us relive the death of Jesus. We sit beside Him in the garden before he is arrested (The Agony in the Garden). Through meditating on these events, we attempt to encounter the suffering Jesus endured for us.

To learn more about the mysteries, please click the link in our bio and read our "How to Pray: The Rosary" blog.

- Hallow team-led guided prayer nights
- A pop-up banner with a Hallow direct download QR code
- A few hundred bulletin inserts to serve as a daily reminder to pray

We are so thrilled to announce the release of Latin Prayers! 🙏

In the Hallow App, you can now listen and meditate to the Rosary in Latin and much more, including the Pater Noster, Salve Regina and Angelus. 📿

These prayers are led by Fr. Matthew Schuster, SJS, a member of the Canons Regular of St. John Cantius and associate pastor at St. John Cantius Parish in Chicago, IL.

One of our favorite things about the Church is the wide variety of ways that we can celebrate our faith together. We hope that you enjoy this addition to the app!

This week, we released the last section of Bible in a Year with @fathermikeschmitz! 📖

It is hard to believe that the year is almost over! Share some of your favorite things about this journey in the comments below, we would love to hear them! ⬇️

#BIY #FatherMike #Ascension #Return #Gospel #Bible #Catholic #HallowApp #JesusDaily #Prayeveryday #Readthebible #ascension

Today is the feast of Christ the King and the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary! 🙏

"On this feast day... the Church proclaims the Kingdom of Christ, already present, but still growing in all its mystery towards its full manifestation ... young people are indispensable bearers of the dynamics of the Kingdom of God, the hope of the Church and the world." - St. John Paul II

To celebrate Christ the King, join @franciscus for the Global Celebration of Young People. This is a day to celebrate the youth and young adults in their faith communities. 🙌

—————

The Presentation of the Blessed Virgin is based on tradition that says Mary was taken to the temple in Jerusalem and dedicated to God at 3-years-old.

Although this event cannot be proven historically, it has been celebrated since the sixth century in the East and the 15th century in the West.

When we celebrate this day, we recognize that Mary placed her whole self in service of God and we are invited to do the same.

On entering the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother; and they knelt down and paid him homage. Then, opening their treasure chests, they offered him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. - Matthew 2:11

We are so excited to journey with you this Advent for Hallow’s third #Pray25 Challenge. The #Pray25 Challenge is an awesome way to ignite your prayer life and bring you into community with thousands around the world to pray and meditate on the birth of Jesus.

This year, we will be seeing Advent through the eyes of Mary. As the mother of Jesus, she has a special place in the story of his birth at Christmas.

During the first three weeks of Advent:
👣  We’ll explore the themes of Hope, Faith, and Joy, leaning on Scripture to help us grow in these areas.
💜  We’ll consider how Mary is an example for us, and ask for her help to open our hearts to Jesus.
🙏  We will also pray with alongside incredible Saints, and reflect using multiple types of prayers and methods, like Litanies, Imaginative Prayer, Lectio Divina, and Examens.
🎶  We will also release exclusive Advent & Christmas music and Christmas Bible Stories, including two new kids Bible Stories!

Then, for the final 7 days of Advent, Mary will lead us, as she always does, to her Son. We’ll reflect on who Christ is through his titles in the traditional “O Antiphons” as we bid him to come into our lives and into our world.

To learn more about the Advent and why we meditate with Mary, please click the link in our bio and read our "Advent 2021 – #Pray25 Journey with Mary to Christmas" blog.

This Advent we are so excited to begin our journey together with Mary. Advent is a beautiful season in which we prepare to invite Jesus into our hearts and homes at Christmas. And who better to lead us through this season than the woman who was there at the start of it all?

During the first three weeks of Advent, we'll explore three themes of Advent: Hope, Faith, and Joy. We'll lean on Scripture to help us understand and grow in these virtues and on Mary as we ask for her help in opening our hearts to Jesus.

This week, we begin with the theme of Hope. 🙏

Mary’s “yes” to bring Christ to the world stemmed from her hope in the promises of God that fill the Old Testament, promises telling the Jewish people a savior would come. Mary's knowledge of God's Word and memory of God's works gave her the courage to place her trust in Him above all else.

Let’s hold Mary’s example of hope in our mind this week as we meditate on this virtue, looking to Scripture to show us the way.

Today we celebrate the Feast of St. Andrew!

St. Andrew was one of the original 12 apostles and brother to St. Peter.

On this day, we celebrate St. Andrew with a novena. The St. Andrew Christmas Novena is traditionally prayed 15 times each day from November 30th through Christmas Eve. This prayer invites us to bring our intentions to the manger. 🙌

This novena is free to all members of the Hallow community. Please join us in prayer with the St. Andrew Christmas Novena by scrolling to the middle of the home page in the Hallow App in the Novena section.

Less than a week to join the #Pray25 Challenge by the deadline to help support Mary's Meals 🙌

 As a reminder, for every person that joins the #Pray25 Challenge by December 3 we will donate $1 to feed children at schools in Liberia. $1 is the equivalent of 10 meals for a child (for $21 we can feed a child for an entire year, so invite 20 friends!).

@marysmeals sets up community-run school feeding projects in some of the world's poorest communities to provide one daily meal in a place of learning that attracts chronically poor children into the classroom, where they receive an education that can be their ladder out of poverty. 🙏

Thank you to everyone that has joined this challenge so far! We have 69,518 members of the Hallow community on the waitlist. That is $69,518 going toward Mary's Meals!

To join the challenge, just open your Hallow App and scroll down on the home screen until you see "Join Advent Waitlist" 🙌

Today we celebrate the Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary. 🙏 It is said that from the moment of her conception, the Blessed Virgin was free from original sin. This Feast celebrates the conception of Mary in the womb of St. Anne.

Today is the feast day of Our Lady of Guadalupe!

To honor this day, we want to reflect on this devotion to Our Lady and invite her into our homes and hearts as we begin the next week of Advent.

This week's theme is joy. As we prepare for this week, as part of the #Pray25 Advent Challenge, we will meditate together on the powerful words from Our Lady of Guadalupe as she asks St. Juan Diego: "Am I not the source of your joy?"

In the Church's calendar the 3rd Sunday of Advent is given the name "Gaudete Sunday, meaning "rejoice!" This third week of Advent stands apart from the rest as we let the joy of Christ's coming soon fill us as we approach Christmas day.

#communitychallenge #hallowapp #catholicmeditation #catholicprayer #adventchallenge #pray25 #joy

Today we celebrate the feast of St. Lucy!

To learn more about St. Lucy, head to the Hallow App and listen to the Daily Saint. 🙏

Here it is, the launch of Hallow Kids!

It has been such a blessing to journey with everyone this Advent season as we prepare for Christmas. One of the greatest joys and wonders of this season is meditating on how God, the Creator of the world, humbles Himself to become a little child born in a manger. 🙏

In the spirit of that mystery, we're so excited to share this launch with you all! 🚀

Since Hallow first launched, we have gotten requests for content written specifically for children. In order to make sure we got it right, all of our sessions have been written and recorded by an amazing team of experienced Catholic school teachers. 💜

Today, we wanted to highlight our new Bedtime Stories narrated by Mario Lopez (@mariolopez) and Jen Fulwiler (@jenniferfulwiler)!

We hope that you and your children are able to feel peace, deepen your relationship with God, and sleep soundly every night as you listen to the retelling of The Story of Christmas.

¡Las Posadas Navideñas son ahora nuestro mas reciente lanzamiento en español! 🙌

Las Posadas son una celebración de nueve días en preparación para la Navidad. En Las Posadas recordamos y celebramos el peregrinaje de María y José hacia Belén donde nació Jesús. 🙏

Las Posadas se celebran comúnmente en México y algunos otros países de habla hispana donde las familias y las comunidades se reúnen en sus casas y en las calles para acompañar a María y José con cantos y oraciones.

Acompáñanos todos los días hasta la Nochebuena en la versión Español de Hallow donde reflexionaremos sobre los pasajes de la Anunciación hasta el Nacimiento de Jesús y escucharemos los tradicionales Cantos de Las Posadas. 📖

____________________

Our newest release on Hallow Español is Las Posadas! 🙌

Las Posadas is a nine day celebration in preparation for Christmas Day. In Las Posadas, we remember and celebrate the Pilgrimage of Mary and Joseph to Bethlehem where Jesus was born! 

Posadas are commonly celebrated in Mexico and other Spanish speaking countries where families and communities get together in homes and on the streets to accompany Mary and Joseph with songs and prayers. 🙏

Join us everyday until Christmas Eve in the Spanish version of the Hallow app, as we reflect on scripture readings on the narrative from the annunciation to the birth of Jesus. 📖

The final week of Advent is here! We can’t thank everyone enough for including us on your Advent journey. 💜

As we begin this final week, we pray that the peace of Christ be with us. 🕊️

As Mary always points and leads us to her Son, our journey in the Advent #Pray25 Challenge continues with us our closing series on the “O Antiphons”.

Hallow Tip: Try the longer versions in the app as you pray this week. For these final days, we’ll be meditating on the O’Antiphons sung in Latin by Harpa Dei - the amazing group who sing the Hallow-favorite Chant Rosary! 🙌

#hallowapp #hallow #advent #pray25 #prayer #prayerchangesthings #oantiphon #peace

We are so blessed to have such amazing music featured on the Hallow App. 🎶

Have you listened to the O’Antiphons sung in Latin by Harpa Dei yet? We are also delighted to have released another album.

O Emmanuel from Grammy award-winning composer, J.J Wright (@jjwrightmusic), is such a treat. Each of his songs is a unique interpretation of the O’Antiphons, blending sacred music with jazz.

We hope experiencing the O’Antiphons in new ways will help you deeper your prayer 🙏

Today we celebrate the feast of the Holy Family as we mark the end of the Holy Family Novena that began on December 17th!

The feast of the Holy Family is dedicated to each member of the Holy Family. With this novena, we commemorate their life together and celebrate religious family life. We hope you enjoyed praying with your family over nine days with Jesus, Joseph and Mary. 💜

If you didn’t get a chance to pray this beautiful novena, you can find it in the Hallow App under the Kids tab.

May God bless all of the families in our community and beyond. 🙌

During the #Pray25 Advent Challenge, we explored the themes of Hope, Faith and Joy while leaning on Scripture to help us grow. 🙌

We prayed alongside incredible Saints and looked to Mary as an example for us as we asked for her help to open our hearts to Jesus.

We were introduced to new Christmas Bible Stories, kids content and exclusive Advent & Christmas music.

We also reflected using multiple types of prayers and methods, like Litanies, Imaginative Prayer, Lectio Divina and Examens.

We can’t thank you all enough for joining us on this journey and we hope this helped ignite your prayer life.

Let us know in the comments what your favorite part of #Pray25 was this year. ⬇️

Today is the Feast of St. John the Apostle!

Also called St. John the Evangelist and St. John the Divine, St. John wrote the Gospel of John as well as the book of Revelation. 📖

John and his brother St. James were among the first to be called upon as disciples by Jesus. Among the Twelve Disciples, he is the only one who did not die a martyr.

Listen to the Daily Saint in the Hallow App for more as we meditate on Jesus’ commandment with his beloved disciple.

Today is the Feast of the Holy Innocents.

The Holy Innocents are the children mentioned in the Gospel of Matthew, chapter 2:16-18.

This day is in remembrance of the massacre of young children in Bethlehem by King Herod the Great in his attempt to kill the infant Jesus. These children were considered by the early church to be the first martyrs.

To pray and reflect on this day, listen to the Daily Saint on the Hallow App. 🙏

#holyinnocents #feastday #gospel #gospelofmatthew #hallow #hallowapp #saintoftheday

St. Thomas Becket, also known as Saint Thomas of Canterbury was the Archbishop of Canterbury beginning in 1162.

Today is his Feast Day! St. Thomas was a strong man who stood firm in defense of truth.

He teaches us that when faced with pressures, we must also take a stand for the greater good.

#feastday #feast #saintoftheday #dailysaint #hallow #hallowapp

Today we recognize St. Stephen!

St. Stephen’s official feast day is December 26th, the same day as the Feast of the Holy Family 👨‍👩‍👦

The story of St. Stephen is that of the first Christian martyr. He worked along with six other deacons to care for the poor in his community. 

St. Stephen spoke about Jesus and how Jesus was the savior promised by God. 🙏

Many who heard his words became followers of Jesus. Others opposed his teachings.

Those who opposed him came together to say that Stephen was spreading false words against God. 

Eventually St. Stephen was stoned for this. During this event, St. Stephen was said to have been praying for his prosecutors. 

#saint #dailysaint #saintoftheday #prayer #prayerchangesthings #hallow #hallowapp

Today is the feast of St. Sylvester I 🙏

 Also known as Pope Sylvester I, his long tenure as the Pope from 314 to 335 saw the beginnings of the Christian Roman Empire.

Little is known about Sylvester’s early life. According to legend, Sylvester converted and baptized Constantine, who was the first Roman emperor to become a Christian!

With a position as Pope spanning critical events such as the emergence of the Church and the building of several basilicas, we can learn a lot from St. Sylvester I when it comes to authority and leadership.

New Years Day is the official Feast of the Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God. 🙏

This celebration is the Octave of Christmas. Only Christmas and Easter how an Octave, which is an eight day extension of the feast.

The feast is a celebration of Mary’s motherhood of Jesus. On this day, we are reminded of the role she played in our salvation.

Through the Holy Spirit, God prepared Mary to give birth and Mary accepted the call: “Let it be done to me as you say" (Luke 1:38)

On this day, we ask that our salvation be brought to its fulfillment. Mary, Mother of God, pray for us.

Los Reyes Magos: Según relatos tradicionales, Melchor, Gaspar y Baltazar ofrecieron a Jesús oro, incienso y mirra como símbolos de su magestad, sacralidad y humanidad.

Aun hasta el día de hoy, muchos de nuestros pueblos celebran la venida de los Reyes de Oriente cada 6 de Enero.

Escribir una carta, dejar un zapato bajo el árbol de navidad, y reunirnos en familia para compartir la rosca de reyes, son solo algunas de estas tradiciones que siguen vigentes.

Celebremos juntos esta gran tradición!

——————

The Magi: According to traditional accounts, Melchior, Gaspar and Baltazar offered Jesus gold, incense and myrrh as symbols of his majesty, sacredness and humanity.

Today, many places continue to celebrate the coming of the Kings of the East every January 6.

To celebrate, you can write a letter, leave a shoe under the Christmas tree, and get together as a family to share the rosca de reyes.

Let's celebrate this great tradition together!

Today is the Feast of the Baptism of the Lord!

The Feast of the Baptism of the Lord signifies the end of the Christmas season. It also marks the beginning of Jesus’ ministry and confirms his identity as the Son of God.

On this day, we are encouraged not only to think about the baptism of the Lord, but our own baptisms. Thanks be to God, who has redeemed us from our sins and given us eternal life through Jesus Christ.

We can celebrate this day through reading about baptisms, praying the Luminous Mysteries and renewing our baptismal promise. 🙏

“If the psalm prays, you pray; if it laments, you lament; if it exults, you rejoice; if it hopes, you hope; if it fears, you fear. Everything written here is a mirror for us.” - St. Augustine

As we settle into the new year, we’re also settling into new routines, and many folks have asked us for ways to incorporate prayer into their morning schedules. And we thought: what better way than by beginning each day with the psalms?

In the brand-new Morning Psalms series on the app, we couldn’t be more excited to share that Bishop Robert Barron (@bishopbarron) from Word on Fire (@wordonfire_catholicministries) will powerfully guide us through the journey of the psalmists. Each day begins with a few verses from Psalm 95 before praying with a unique daily psalm. These psalms will rotate on a daily cycle and repeat every four weeks, similar to the structure of the Liturgy of the Hours.

Tomorrow morning, we invite you to start your day today with these powerful prayers. We pray you find it fruitful and that it helps you orient your day toward God.

Today we celebrate St. Josephine Bakhita! 🤍

St. Josephine spent many years as a slave after being kidnapped at the age of 7 from her birthplace of southern Sudan.

In 1890, she was baptized and confirmed after feeling drawn to the Catholic Church.

Josephine entered the Institute of St. Magdalene of Canossa in 1893 and became well loved by those she assisted.

While enslaved, St. Josephine never lost her spirit and her Baptism set her on a path toward asserting her freedom and service to God’s people as a Canossian sister.

She is the patron saint of Sudan and human-trafficking survivors. Let us pray for all souls and victims of oppression and violence!

Bring Lent #Pray40 to Your Parish 🙌

As we approach Lent this year, we're incredibly excited to announce new ways that parishes can journey through Hallow's #Pray40 challenge together.

Our hope is that sharing the #Pray40 challenge will be a unifying experience for entire parish communities, coming together as one Church, in a daily life of prayer.

We also hope that it will serve as an invitation to those who don't attend Mass that frequently, or that haven't been in a long time, to rediscover a personal relationship with God by reflecting on his sacrifice on the cross.

Click the link in our bio to order a FREE parish kit, which includes a pop-banner with a scannable QR code, handouts, pew inserts, digital communication resources, and evangelization tools to help strengthen your fellow parishioners' prayer lives. 🙏

What are you focusing on for Lent?

Share this post in your story and fill in the blank with what you would like to commit to this Lenten season!

#Hallow #HallowApp #Lent #AshWednesday #Fasting #Almsgiving #prayer

From our blog post: “What to Give Up For Lent in 2022: Practical Fasting Ideas for Lent”, Lent is more than just “giving something up” and fasting from meat on Fridays. 🙌

Ask yourself - what pulls me away from loving God, loving others, and loving myself well? How can I incorporate acts of sacrifice, acts of giving, and acts of prayer that will help me love as God loves?

Pope Francis challenges us to think about fasting as something more powerful that we normally consider it, describing it as “learning to change our attitude towards others and all of creation, turning away from the temptation to ‘devour’ everything to satisfy our voracity and being ready to suffer for love, which can fill the emptiness of our hearts.”

For Lent this year, our Hallow social media accounts will be dark on Fridays. A testament to our commitment to our Lenten promises and goals of forming a deeper relationship with God.

If you are planning to give up social media for Lent, we encourage you to screenshot this post and use it as your last post for Lent! A reminder that the goal of sacrifice is to remember the sacrifices Jesus made and bring us closer to God. 💜

Check out our #Pray40 prayer companion! ✍️

We have provided a way for you to write out reflections and prayers from the sessions in the app. While we have the journaling feature within the app, this Lent we wanted to provide a space for deeper reflection and conversation with God.

We know it can be easy to get stuck or forget what you decided to focus on for Lent. So, we created this guide for you to work on as you pray over the next 40 days! Our hope is that you experience Lent in a new and beautiful way. 🙏

Print out this guide and take it on your walk with Jesus! You can download it via the link in our bio or by visiting http://hallow.com/lentcompanion.

Using this guide, turn the #Pray40 challenge into your own Lenten study, done alone or with friends and loved ones! 💜

Each Wednesday, we will pray a litany together relating to the Last Word of the week.

A litany is a series of short petitions, each with a response. They can be great and simple ways to keep our minds focused during prayer.

Our last word this week is "Amen, I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise" and we’ve focused a lot on God’s kingdom and Christ as King, so today our litany will be the Litany to Christ the King.

Let’s pray in this moment together and meditate on the second word of Christ’s 7 Last Words. 💜

The USCCB (@usccb) tells us that during Lent, “we seek the Lord in prayer by reading Sacred Scripture; we serve by giving alms; and we practice self-control through fasting.”

Hallow has a wonderful set of prayer resources for every step of your the Lenten journey. Along with #Pray40, you can pray with our Daily Gospel Reflections, Daily Rosary prayers, Saint prayers and night prayer 🙏

Almsgiving reminds us of Jesus’s call to serve and connects us in solidarity with our brothers and sisters in need. 👫

While most Catholics are familiar with “no meat on Fridays” during Lent, fasting and abstinence are important components throughout Lent. This may look like giving up things like gossip, your favorite coffee order, or forgoing music in the car and replacing it with prayer. 🤔

Have you listened to the Stations of the Cross, led by Jim Caviezel (@therealjimcaviezel/) 🙏

The Stations of the Cross, also known as the Way of the Cross and the Way of Sorrow (Via Crucis in Latin), detail fourteen different moments on the day Jesus died. This prayer pilgrimage is a powerful way to grow closer to Jesus at any time of the year, though it is most popular during the Lenten season.

At the end of each week, we will pray pray through the Stations together during #Pray40. Head to our blog post for more in depth information on how to Pray the Stations ✝️

#Hallow #HallowApp #Pray #Pray40 #Lent #Lent2022

Each Wednesday, we will pray a litany together relating to the Last Word of the week.

A litany is a series of short petitions, each with a response. They can be great and simple ways to keep our minds focused during prayer.

Our focus this week has been on the Last Word of Jesus giving us His mother, we’ll pray today the Litany to Our Lady of Sorrows, a prayer composed by Pope Pius VII.

In this litany, we'll call upon the Mother of God under different names and titles. You'll hear invocations, like "Haven of the shipwrecked," "Strength of the weak," and "Refuge of the abandoned." As we pray, hold in your mind the great range of who Mary is for us and know that with anything we need, we can go to her and find solace.

Let’s pray in this moment together and meditate on the third word of Christ’s 7 Last Words. 💜

The Fourth Word inspired us to collaborate with Cross Catholic this Lent.

Cross Catholic is a non-profit that builds wells and supports clean water initiatives across some of the most impoverished areas in Africa. 🚰

Thank you to everyone who joined the #Pray40 Challenge! With your help, we were able to donate $100,000 to help support the mission of @crosscatholic!

Hallow donated $1 for each of the first 100,000 participants in the #Pray40 challenge to Cross Catholic Outreach. Because of this, we were able to provide funds to build 24 wells and provide a lifetime of clean water to 4,000 people across the continent.

Each Wednesday, we will pray a litany together relating to the Last Word of the week.

A litany is a series of short petitions, each with a response. They can be great and simple ways to keep our minds focused during prayer.

This week, we’ve been reflecting on the thirst Jesus has for souls and our call to bear good fruit with His Last Word: “I thirst.” 

Today, as we have been on Wednesdays, we’re going to pray with a litany. We’ve focused the last few days on how Jesus thirsts for us and for our love, but today we’re going to shift our focus to how, in saying these words, Jesus identifies Himself with all those who hunger or thirst and are in need, both spiritually and physically. Today’s litany is adapted from Hallow's Works of Mercy Challenge on giving drink to the thirsty.

Let’s pray in this moment together and meditate on the fourth word of Christ’s 7 Last Words. 💜

Tomorrow is the Solemnity of the Annunciation 🙏

On this day, the Angel Gabriel announced to the Virgin Mary that she would conceive a son and name him Jesus, for he would save his people from their sins. Mary said in reply, “Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord. Be it done unto me according to your word” (Luke 1:38).

With humility, the Pope will be making a solemn Act of Consecration tomorrow to the Immaculate Heart of Mary.

He will be entrusting Russia and Ukraine to Mary's intercession, lifting up the suffering of all, and imploring an end to the war. The Pope has asked the entire Church to unite with him in this prayer.

Join us tomorrow in offering prayers for peace on the final day of our Immaculate Heart Novena 💜

Happy Laetare Sunday!

Laetare is Latin for "Rejoice!" It's taken from the antiphon sung at the beginning of today's Mass. This fourth Sunday of Lent is given this title because it is the halfway point of the season.

We'll answer that call to joy today as we meditate this week on an excerpt from the Year C cycle of the Gospels: the story of the Prodigal Son. We'll then meditate on this week’s last word: "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” ✝️

Each Wednesday, we will pray a litany together relating to the Last Word of the week.

A litany is a series of short petitions, each with a response. They can be great and simple ways to keep our minds focused during prayer.

This week’s Word has been: “My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?” We remember Pope Benedict’s words from yesterday that, because of its reference to Psalm 22, “this cry of extreme anguish is at the same time the certainty of an answer from God”. In his desolation, Christ remains faithful. In His abandonment, he still trusts.

In this session, we will build off of this theme of trusting in God, even when it may seem that all hope is lost, by praying the Litany of Trust, a beautiful litany composed by Sr. Faustina Maria Pia of the Sisters of Life. We're grateful to them for sharing these powerful words with us.

Let’s pray in this moment together and meditate on the fifth word of Christ’s 7 Last Words. 💜

Each Wednesday, we will pray a litany together relating to the Last Word of the week.

A litany is a series of short petitions, each with a response. They can be great and simple ways to keep our minds focused during prayer.

This week, we’ve been meditating on Jesus’ final words in John’s Gospel: “It is finished.” After Jesus dies, Joseph of Arimathea steps forward to take him down from the cross. He wraps Jesus' body in burial cloths, and lays him in the tomb.

Today, we’ll meditate on this work of mercy by praying a litany for those who have died and for those who grieve. This session may be emotionally heavy for some, especially for anyone who has recently lost a loved one. If you are not able to continue through this session, please know that we, as a community, are praying for you and your loved ones. 🙏

Let’s pray in this moment together and meditate on the sixth word of Christ’s 7 Last Words. 💜

We are incredibly excited and humbled to announce our partnership with @fatherstumovie to share a special introduction on @hallowapp from @markwahlberg and audio clips from the film that will inspire you, challenge you, and deepen your faith in God as we head into Easter. 🙏

"Father Stu" is an incredible story of a lost soul who became a fighter and found his purpose in an unexpected place, as a priest. It is a real, raw, and inspirational story that teaches us that no one is too far gone from God's love, forgiveness, and mercy. ✝️

Prepare to watch the film when it releases in theaters next Wednesday by listening to Mark's intro and audio clips free in the Hallow App.

We are incredibly excited to share our next Hallow Community Challenge: The Divine Mercy Novena, led by none other than @fathermikeschmitz! 🕊 

Jesus asked Saint Faustina that the Feast of the Divine Mercy be preceded by a Novena to the Divine Mercy which would begin on Good Friday. Each day, we are called to pray for a different group of souls, ending with the most difficult on the last day -  the lukewarm and indifferent. 

"On each day of the novena you will bring to My heart a different group of souls and you will immerse them in this ocean of My mercy ... On each day you will beg My Father, on the strength of My passion, for the graces for these souls." - Saint Faustina

We are so blessed to pray this incredibly powerful Novena alongside @fathermikeschmitz beginning next Friday, Good Friday. Join the waitlist today on the Home Tab. As an Easter blessing, this community challenge is completely free for all users! 🙏

Today, Palm Sunday 🌿, we enter into Holy Week as we begin the journey with Christ to His Passion, Death and Resurrection. 
We reflect today on His triumphant entrance into Jerusalem shortly followed by His crucifixion. We hear as He is praised and glorified riding on a donkey, and when He is shouted at, mocked, and abandoned hanging on a cross. ✝️
Jesus knew when he entered into the Holy City what would happen just a few days later, He knew as He cried out in anguish to His Father on the Mount of Olives, that he would be beaten, nailed to a cross, and die for our sins. He knew what would be the depth of suffering, but He took it on, for you. 🙏
As we prepare to enter this week, let us unite our sufferings to His. Let us say, Father, not my will but Your's be done. Allow yourself to draw near to Jesus: pray with Him, meditate with Him, and feel His unconditional love for you. Love so great that knowing the kind of death He was to experience, He chose it anyways, for you. 🕊

This week’s last Word: "Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit,” is all about surrendering ourselves to the will of God. Instead of praying a litany today, we'll repeat a short but powerful prayer that comes from the Surrender Novena.

In this prayer we’ll repeat the following words 10 times, "O Jesus, I surrender myself to You. Take care of everything!"

Let’s take a few moments of silence to collect our hearts and minds. 💜

Today is Holy Thursday - the day when Jesus shares his Last Supper with the Apostles, washes their feet, and institutes both the priesthood and the Eucharist. 🙏

A reading from the first letter of St. Paul to the Corinthians (1 Cor 11:23-26):
23 For I received from the Lord what I also handed on to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took a loaf of bread, 24 and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, “This is my body that is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.” 25 In the same way he took the cup also, after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.” 26 For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes. 🙌

Not only that, but we even boast of our afflictions, knowing that affliction produces endurance, and endurance, proven character, and proven character, hope, and hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit that has been given to us.

What is one thing that stood out to you from this passage? Let us know in the comments!

Today we celebrate the Feast of St. Thomas More 🙏

St. Thomas More is the patron saint of adopted children, lawyers, civil servants, politicians and difficult marriages.

Fun fact: St. Thomas More had a great sense of humor. May we all be blessed with more laughter in our lives. 💟

#Hallow #FeastDay #GoodHumor

Today is the Solemnity of the Most Scared Heart, a feast that signifies Christ's immense, unconditional, burning love for all of us.

Devotion to the Sacred Heart is devotion to Jesus and his love. It is a sign or a symbol of both the divine and human love that Jesus has for his Father and for us. It also symbolizes the interior life of Jesus which led to his willingness to lay down his life for us.

Today, we echo the thoughts of the great Saint, St. John Paul II, “This feast reminds us of the mystery of the love of God for the people of all times.”

The Sacred Heart is a refuge for us all, especially those who feel afraid, forgotten,  alone, those who are most vulnerable in our society, women facing unexpected or difficult pregnancies, for the unborn, and for those suffering from abortion. 

Today, we join our hearts to His as we meditate on His sacrificial love poured out from His heart on The Cross. 

#sacredheart #sacredheartofjesus #prayerchangesthings #refuge #feastday

Today we celebrate the feast of the Immaculate Heart of Mary! On this day, let us imitate Mary’s heart by sharing in her faithfulness to Jesus!

Hey friends! I’m making a rare LIVESTREAM appearance TODAY in a few hours!

I’m stoked to chat about our  newest prayer challenge called “July with Jesus”. I’ll be reading Jesus’ parables (YOU pick the voice!) and giving you thought-provoking meditations to help you stay spiritually centered amidst the craziness this summer! 
🙏🏽✝️♥️

We also may touch on a few other topics - including rumors I’m somehow feeling the pressure to train harder now that fellow prayer guide @markwahlberg is on the @hallowapp scene…
I mean…no…I’m in no way challenged by the absolutely ridiculous shape he’s in or his brutal daily physical regimen…so let’s just…we don’t need to address it…-okay we might need to address it…-no we’re NOT gonna address it…

ANYWAY- see you there!!

How is everyone enjoying the July with Jesus challenge with @jonathanroumieofficial ?

Let us know your answer to the reflection questions in the comments below 💭

#julywithjesus

During week 2 of #JulywithJesus, we are meditating on parables that teach us how to forgive, embrace the cross, prepare, and be the light of Christ in our lives.

In today’s session, we’ll listen to the Parable of the Unforgiving Debtor and reflect on forgiveness 🤝

What are your thoughts on today’s reflection question? Let us know in the comments 👇

💭 #julywithjesus

July with Jesus will continue beyond the Parables Challenge! Starting this coming Monday, we’ll pray alongside Jim Caviezel, the actor who portrayed Jesus in The Passion of the Christ.

Join Jim as we pray the Saint Michael Chaplet together over nine days. An incredible prayer that arms us against Satan and strengthens us amidst our daily stresses and struggles.

#julywithjesus #stmichael #chaplet

As we near the end of the #JulywithJesus parables challenge, we’ll focus on parables that describe the Final Judgment. 

Everyday we face choices that bring us closer to God or turn us away from Him. In his parables, Jesus shows us that death is the time when our acceptance or rejection of God's grace and mercy will be final, and he challenges us to be prepared to meet God after death. 

Today we'll pray with the parable of Lazarus and the Rich Man. What stood out to you from this parable? Let us know in the comments!

Today is the last day of the Parables challenge with @jonathanroumieofficial 🙏

In this final session, we’ll close with our final parable on discipleship. This is a parable that we may have all heard a hundred times, but let’s try to enter into it today anew. Let the words sink in as though this is the first time you’ve heard them.

How can you be Christ to those around you? 💭

#JulywithJesus #Parables

The July with Jesus challenge continued today! Have you joined yet?

Over the next nine days, we will pray the St. Michael Chaplet alongside Jim Caviezel. To those who pray it daily, God promises to bring the help of St. Michael and the nine choirs of angels throughout our life on earth. This specific prayer is near and dear to the hearts of many, including Jim’s, which is what makes him the perfect guide for us all.

We’re so excited to continue July with Jesus with you.🤗 #JulywithJesus

Today is the Feast Day of Saint Mary Magdalene, a beautiful example of God's forgiveness, grace, and love. Saint Mary Magdalene was one of the last people to remain with Christ on the cross and one of the first to see Him in His resurrection ✝️. She was beloved by her teacher despite the sins of her past. Her life and redemption is a model for us all. Saint Mary Magdalene, pray for us 🙏

"Martha, burdened with much serving, came to him and said, “Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me by myself to do the serving? Tell her to help me.” The Lord said to her in reply, “Martha, Martha, you are anxious and worried about many things. There is need of only one thing. Mary has chosen the better part and it will not be taken from her.” Luke 10:40-42

Hail, Queen of Heaven 👑

Today is the Feast of the Queenship of Mary. Mary, whose assumption into heaven we celebrated last week, is Queen of  Heaven. This originates back to the Old Testament where the queen was not the wife of the king but the mother who interceded just like Mary did when she asked Jesus to turn water into wine at the wedding at Cana. 
Celebrate this beautiful feast today by continuing the Marian Consecration or praying the Hail Holy Queen

“It is necessary that the heroic becomes daily and that the daily becomes heroic.” – St. Zelie Martin

It’s Day 1 of the next Saint in 7 Days with Sts. Louis and Zelie Martin! 
 
In this session we learn about how Louis and Zelie both reached the threshold of religious life and then ultimately journeyed to marriage with one another. Building on the humility and charity we reflected on with Mother Teresa, Saints Louis and Zelie are an inspiration to all of us, especially those of us who are parents.

How is everyone enjoying our Saint in 7 Days series?

For this final week, we begin on a journey with St. Martin de Porres.

Day 1 will take you through Martin’s childhood in Peru and how his identity was impacted by three things on the day of his birth.

Each week with the saints has been incredibly powerful. We hope that you continue to be inspired by Martin’s gentle and humble heart and how he served others throughout his life. ♥️

Happy All Saints Eve!  Many of you know of my affinity for the Christian meditation (post-it’s-Roman-origins) of Memento Mori which translates roughly to “Remember that you must die.” But we shouldn’t think of this phrase in a macabre way but rather in a “life and everything in this world is ephemeral and fleeting” kind of way. To take the moment NOW to appreciate what you have and Who (☝🏽) gave it to you! 
Some may regard this imagery (despite its symbolism for me) and be reminded that evil spirits exist, and that we are at war. Well that’s also completely and biblically true (Eph 6:12). That’s why I’m so excited to join the Spiritual Warfare Course today on @hallowapp with Fr. Vincent Lampert, one of only 150 appointed exorcists in the United States, who receives over 3,500 inquiries a year from people dealing with the demonic and seeking help from the Church. I’ve spoken to Fr. Vincent before and let me tell you he is the real deal. 
For more fascinating facts and figures read on below my link to check out this course FOR FREE:
www.hallow.com/Jonathan!
🙏🏽🙌🏽💪🏽♥️

+++++++++

In this one-of-a-kind Hallow Course, you’ll not only hear about Fr. Lampert’s journey and stories of real-life exorcisms, but more importantly learn how you can fight your own battles and combat the devil in everyday life.

Learn who the devil truly is, his deceptive ways, and how he tempts and distorts the truth of God. Fr. Vincent will dive deep into specific prayers and meditations for your life as well as how the Church handles the devil’s attempt to control us and push us away from God’s will.

“Why talk about such an uncomfortable topic like exorcism and the devil? The reason is simple: the devil is real, and we need to learn how to recognize him, battle him, and win.” – Fr. Vincent Lampert

Are you ready for Advent!? The Hallow Advent #Pray25 featuring The Chosen challenge begins tomorrow!!

This Advent, we’ll prepare in our own hearts to welcome Jesus once again by meditating on passages in Scripture that led to that night in the manger.

We’ll spend time with Ruth and reflect on her immense faith. We’ll reflect on the anointing of David, the lineage of Jesse’s tree, and prophecies that foretold the birth of Jesus.

In the daily reflections of Advent #Pray25, we’ll see how from the Old Testament to the New Testament, God has called people throughout generations.

At times our own lives may seem uncertain. Our treks – literal and figurative – can feel as if there’s no end in sight. We wait. We journey forward hopefully.

And when we finally celebrate the arrival of Jesus on Christmas Day, we feel a peace and joy only possible by the beautiful, universe-altering Incarnation.

Join #Pray25 today and pray with Hallow this Advent 🙏

“Once in our world, a stable had something in it that was bigger than our whole world.” – C.S. Lewis

It is only fitting that the first candle on the Advent wreath represents Hope – the first Sunday of Advent not only leads us to anticipate the birth of Christ but celebrate the beginning of a new liturgical season as well. The first candle is purple, the primary color of Advent and a color symbolizing royalty.

Sometimes called the “Prophecy Candle,” the first candle harkens us back to Isaiah’s foretelling of the birth of Christ and all of the promises God gave us in the Old Testament that would be fulfilled by the birth of Jesus.

Giving Tuesday began in 2012 as a day that encourages people to do good. Over the years, it has turned into a movement that inspires people to celebrate generosity.

Giving yourself to others has no bounds! If you are in need of inspiration, consider:
💛 Volunteering at a local charity
💛 Donating to your favorite cause or a fundraiser
💛 Praying for others

This week we are joined by @georgehxanthis who will take us through some of the early Old Testament stories of human fallenness and brokenness beginning with Adam and Eve.

When God first seeks a relationship with Adam and Eve, they hide. Reflect on the times when you have been tempted to hide from God’s presence in your life.

How has He continued to call on you in these moments?

Today is the feast of St. Andrew! 

St. Andrew was Jesus’s first apostle and the older brother of St. Peter, the second apostle. 🙌 

The single prayer of the St. Andrew Christmas Novena is traditionally prayed fifteen times each day, beginning on the feast of St. Andrew (today!) and concluding on Christmas Eve. Why do we pray the St. Andrew Christmas Novena? St. Andrew’s feast day of November 30 precedes Christmas and helps us to determine the start of Advent. 💛

Like Noah, Abraham accepts God’s call, but we can only imagine what this “yes” to sacrifice Isaac must have felt like. Abraham does not understand why God would demand such a sacrifice, yet he still surrenders himself to the will of God.

Join @itsmeparas and @jonathanroumieofficial for a reflection today on the Gospel of Matthew in the #Pray25 Sunday Gospel Reflection 🙏💜

“May we be in this world a ray of that light which shone forth from Bethlehem, bringing joy and peace to the hearts of all men and women.” – Pope Francis 

The second candle on the Advent wreath represents Peace. Like the first candle, it is also purple. Often called the “Bethlehem Candle,” the second Advent candle reminds us of Mary and Joseph’s journey from Nazareth to Bethlehem before Mary gave birth to Jesus. 

Building on the meaning of the Prophecy Candle, this second candle recalls that after all of the division, destruction, and dispersion of the kingdom in the Old Testament, there might finally be peace on Earth – Jesus is coming, and so is his Kingdom of Peace. As we read in the quote from Pope Francis, this light of peace shone forth from Bethlehem for all the world. 

#Hallow #HallowApp #ProphecyCandle #BethlehemCandle #Peace

Today, in #Pray25 we reflect with @elizabethtabish on the story of Ruth. Ruth, like Mary, was a woman of action. She worked to make things right in the face of hardship and injustice; she surrendered her plans to God’s will.

How can you imitate Ruth in your own life at home, work or school, or church? In what areas of your life does passivity tempt you from being bold? How can you be bold in your own journey to Bethlehem?

#Hallow #HallowApp #Advent2022 #Advent #TheChosen #Ruth

“The giver of every good and perfect gift has called upon us to mimic His giving, by grace, through faith, and this is not of ourselves.” - St. Nicholas

Today we honor Mary on the Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception. 🕊💜  In today’s Gospel reading, the Angel Gabriel appears before Mary, first startling her and then encouraging her not to be afraid. He announces that she will bear the Son of God, and her cousin Elizabeth will also conceive a son. Mary, without hesitation, responds, “Here am I, the servant of the Lord; let it be with me according to your word.” (Luke 1:38)   As we prepare for the Nativity alongside Mary today on her Immaculate Conception and throughout Advent, how might you also say “Here I am” like Mary? 
 As St. John Paul II prayed, “Pray, O Mother, for all of us.” 🙏 Click the link in our bio to learn more about the Immaculate Conception of Mary!

Happy Gaudete Sunday! 

🕯“But the angel said to them, ‘Do not be afraid; for see — I am bringing you good news of great joy for all the people: to you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is the Messiah, the Lord. This will be a sign for you: you will find a child wrapped in bands of cloth and lying in a manger.’” (Luke 2:10-12) 😇

🕯The third (pink) candle of Advent symbolizes joy. Called the Shepherd’s candle, it takes us back to the joyful anticipation of the shepherds who journeyed to see Jesus in Bethlehem. 🐑 Rejoice, He is near!

“Listen, put it into your heart, most little of my sons: let nothing frighten or grieve you, let not your heart be disturbed, do not fear any sickness or anguish.” - Our Lady of Guadalupe to St. Juan Diego

On December 9, 1531, Mary appeared to St. Juan Diego on Tepeyac Hill (now México City). Three days later, on December 12, Juan Diego received a miraculous sign from the Virgin Mary. On this same day, centuries later, we celebrate the Feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe.

Mary, wrap me in your mantle, just as you wrapped Juan Diego. May you wrap me in your love, too, so that I might grow in the same courage and hope as Juan Diego to seek Christ and love others in this life. And may you guide me closer to your Son, so that I might more fully love Him as you do. 🙏

To learn more about Our Lady of Guadalupe, visit our blog post: Feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe in 2022: Prayers, Celebrations, and More!

#Hallow #HallowApp #OurLadyofGuadalupe #FeastDay

“Then there appeared to him an angel of the Lord, standing at the right side of the altar of incense. When Zechariah saw him, he was terrified; and fear overwhelmed him. But the angel said to him, ‘Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you will name him John. You will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth, for he will be great in the sight of the Lord.’” (Luke 1:11-15) 

This week, we are joined by @david_amito, the actor who portrays John the Baptist in @thechosentvseries. 

We are invited to ponder how Zechariah’s response differs from Mary’s “yes” to the Angel Gabriel. Can you call to mind a few times when your heart has been hardened like Zechariah’s?

It’s Christmas Eve, and under the floorboards of G. K. Chesterton’s home 🏡, curious clues lie hidden … Sister Seraphina and the other Sisters of Our Lady Star of the Sea are busy preparing for the Christmas play and long-awaited feast.

Read the full story by Haley Stewart and enjoy the original illustrations by Betsy Wallin @paulinebooksandmedia

🎶 New Music: Waiting Songs by @rainforroots

These songs are about making time for waiting during Advent. The King is coming and He is already here. So we practice listening, quieting ourselves, celebrating, whispering good news, and yelling shouts of joy.

”Loving Father, Help us remember the birth of Jesus, that we may share in the song of the angels, the gladness of the shepherds, and worship of the wise men … “ (Attributed to Robert Louis Stevenson)

Today is the Feast of St. Stephen the Martyr and the second day in the #OctaveofChristmas. ❤️

The Octave of Christmas is eight days of feasts and holy celebrations in the Church, beginning on Christmas Day and concluding on the Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God (also New Year’s Day). 

We read of St. Stephen in Acts when the apostles chose seven to serve: “They chose Stephen, a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit”(Acts 6:5). Stephen was a man who “did great wonders and signs among the people” and had a face “like the face of an angel”(Acts 6). 😇

Filled with Holy Spirit, St. Stephen died the first martyr of Christ. 🕊 His final words were a short prayer we hold in our hearts today: “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.” Today we remember St. Stephen and all martyrs. 

🙏 St. Stephen pray for us! 
 
#hallowapp #prayerchangesthings #feastday #ststephen #catholicsaint #catholicmartyr

It’s the Feast of St. John the Evangelist 🦅 and the third day in the #OctaveofChristmas! 

”In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things came into being through him, and without him not one thing came into being. What has come into being in him was life, and the life was the light of all people. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it.”

Today we celebrate and pray alongside the author of the Gospel of John, “the one whom Jesus loved” (John 13:23). ❤️ Known for his deep writing on Jesus as the Logos (the Word), it is only fitting that we pray with St. John the Evangelist just two days after Christmas.🎄The Word was in the beginning, and the Word is here with us now — we continue to celebrate the Nativity of Jesus today. 

St. John the Evangelist, pray for us! 🙏

Celebrate the Feast of St. John the Evangelist by listening to the Gospel of John on Hallow, narrated by @JonathanRoumieOfficial! 📖 You can listen to Gospel in full or by chapter (~10 minutes each).

Listen to the Introduction to the course today with @jackie_mulligan, who encourages us to reflect on Mary’s fiat (her “yes” to God), something we prayed about throughout Advent #Pray25! As Jackie asks us, “How will you say ‘yes’ to the work of God’s grace within your body, mind, and soul?” 🙏

Check out this new course on Hallow, which you can find in the Mental Health tab of the app, and let us know what pillar you’re most excited to learn about in the comments! ⬇️

Today is the Feast of the Holy Innocents. 🕊 On this solemn day in the #OctaveofChristmas, we remember all of the children slain by Herod in his search for baby Jesus (Matthew 2:16-18). 

St. Augustine called the holy innocents the “infant martyr flowers.” He wrote, “They were the Church’s first blossoms, matured by the frost of persecution during the cold winter of unbelief.” 

🙏 Reflect with a prayer composed by Archbishop William E. Lori, shared by the @usccb, today:

”O God of all the nations, the One God who is and was and always will be, in your providence you willed that your Church be united to the suffering of your Son. Look with mercy on your servants who are persecuted for their faith in you. Grant them perseverance and courage to be worthy imitators of Christ. Bring your wisdom upon leaders of nations to work for peace among all peoples. May your Spirit open conversion for those who contradict your will, that we may live in harmony. Give us the grace to be united in truth and freedom, and to always seek your will in our lives. Through Christ our Lord. Amen. Our Lady, Queen of Peace, pray for us.” ❤️

“Whosoever wisely examines the works of God will speedily discover what is next to be done.” - St. Thomas Becket 

Today is the Feast of St. Thomas Becket, another Church martyr, and the fifth day in the #OctaveofChristmas.🎄

✝️ On this day in 1170, St. Thomas Becket died a martyr of the Church. He is known to have said, just moments before his passing, “For the name of Jesus and the protection of the Church, I am ready to embrace death.” 

St. Thomas Becket, pray for us! 🙏

#hallowapp #feastday #stthomasbecket

Get ready to start 2023 with @fathermikeschmitz with the new Catechism In a Year series or Bible in a Year, both from Ascension @catholicfaithformation! 🥳

Did you know that the Catechism draws on over 2,000 years of Sacred Scripture, Church Teaching, the Magisterium, and various theologians and saints? It’s a beautiful way to learn and grow deeper in your faith and the perfect way to start off 2023! ✝️

🙏 As we continue praying for the health of Pope Benedict XVI, we can also reflect on his role in drafting the Catechism. ✍️ Pope Benedict XVI, who was then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, led the compiling and writing of the Catechism, at the request of St. (Pope) John Paul II. 

💜 Check out the intro and special bonus episodes of the Catechism In a Year on Hallow tonight!

Today is the Feast of the Holy Family of Mary, Joseph, and Jesus! ❤️#OctaveofChristmas 

Just as we did in #Pray25, spend some time reflecting on the Holy Family today. Imagine what it must have felt like to be Mary or Joseph at this point in history. 🙏 After their journey to Bethlehem, Joseph has a dream in which the angel of the Lord appears to him. As we read in the Gospel of Matthew today, 

”Now after they had left, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, ‘Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you; for Herod is about to search for the child, to destroy him.’ Then Joseph got up, took the child and his mother by night, and went to Egypt, and remained there until the death of Herod. This was to fulfill what had been spoken by the Lord through the prophet, ‘Out of Egypt I have called my son.’” (Matthew 2:13-15)

💭 With patience, humility, and compassion, the Holy Family continued their journey. What can you learn from them as we enter the New Year? How can you imitate the spirit of the Holy Family today? Share your thoughts with us ⬇️

“Those who believe are never alone – neither in life nor in death.” - Pope Benedict XVI

Please join us in prayer as a community in remembrance of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI and for the repose of his soul. 🙏 

For 8 days, we’ll pray alongside excerpts from Pope Benedict’s writings & preaching, guided by Msgr. John Cihak, who served as a Papal Master of Ceremonies for Pope Benedict. Today, we reflect on his first papal homily and then close with the Litany of the Saints. (You can find “In Remembrance” in the Home tab of the app.)

On this solemn day of Pope Benedict XVI’s passing, we also reflect on his words when St. (Pope) John Paul II passed: 

“How alone we all felt after the passing of John Paul II – the Pope who for over twenty-six years had been our shepherd and guide on our journey through life. 

He crossed the threshold of the next life, entering into the mystery of God. But he did not take this step alone. Those who believe are never alone – neither in life nor in death. 

At that moment, we could call upon the Saints from every age – his friends, his brothers, and sisters in the faith – knowing that they would form a living procession to accompany him into the next world, into the glory of God…

I too can say with renewed conviction: I am not alone. All the Saints of God are there to protect me, to sustain me, and to carry me. And your prayers, my dear friends, your indulgence, your love, your faith, and your hope accompany me.”

- Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI

Tomorrow is the Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God, the final day in the #OctaveofChristmas, the World Day of Peace, and New Year’s Day! 🤍 🙏 As we continue praying for Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI and the repose of his soul, we pray with his words on the eve of the Solemnity of Mary: 

🕊 “Jesus is a way that can be traveled, open to everyone. He is the path of peace. Today the Virgin Mary points him out to us, she shows us the Way: let us walk in it! And you, Holy Mother of God, accompany us with your protection. Amen.” - Pope Benedict XVI (2012)

Tonight and tomorrow, also take the time to reflect on these beautiful words from St. (Pope) John Paul II, ten years before Pope Benedict XVI, on the Solemnity of Mary:

🕊 “If Jesus is Life, Mary is the Mother of Life. If Jesus is Hope, Mary is the Mother of Hope. If Jesus is Peace, Mary is the Mother of Peace, Mother of the Prince of Peace. Entering the new year, let us ask this holy Mother to bless us. Let us ask Her to give us Jesus, our full Blessing, in whom the Father blessed all history once and for all, making it become the history of salvation.” - St. (Pope) John Paul II

Today we celebrate the Most Holy Name of Jesus! We acknowledge  the holiness of His name — Jesus, Emmanuel, God with us! ✝️🕊️

”Therefore God also highly exalted him and gave him the name that is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bend, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.” (Philippians 2:9-11) ♥️

🙏 To celebrate His Holy Name, pray the litany to the Most Holy Name of Jesus today! You can find this beautiful litany in the app by going to the Meditate tab > Praylists > Litanies!

Today is the Feast of St. Elizabeth Ann Seton, the first American-born saint! 

Born just before the American Revolution, Elizabeth Ann Bayley was born in 1774 into the Episcopalian Church. She married William Seton at 19, and together they had five children. Soon after, Elizabeth lost William to tuberculosis in Italy. There, she discovered the Catholic faith, joining the Church upon her return to the U.S. In the years that followed, she became an inspiring woman of many “firsts.” 

🏫 Founder of the first free U.S. parish school
🏥 Founder of the U.S.’s first free hospital
😇And the first U.S.-born citizen to become a saint

She was canonized in 1975 by Pope Paul VI, who said, “May the dynamism and authenticity of her life be an example in our day-and for generations to come-of what women can and must accomplish, in the fulfillment of their role, for the good of humanity.” ❤️

St. Elizabeth Ann Seton, pray for us! 🙏

🤲 “…all is in God’s hands. If I had a choice and my own will should decide in a moment, I would remain silent in God’s hands. Oh, how sweet it is to rest there in perfect confidence.” - St. Elizabeth Ann Seton, letter to a friend in 1908 

#hallowapp #stelizabethannseton #allingodshands #catholicsaint #prayforus #prayerchangesthings #catholicmom #catholicschools

Today is the Feast of St. John Neumann, the first bishop to be canonized in America! 

John Neumann was born in 1811 in what is today the Czech Republic. After studying theology at the seminary of Brandeis, he left Europe and journeyed to America, where he was ordained a priest in 1836 by the bishop of New York. ✝️ Part of the Redemptorists order (founded by St. Alphonsus Liguori in the 18th century), John Neumann had a special vocation for immigrants. He spent much of his life serving German immigrant communities in the United States. At the age of 41, John Neumann was ordained the bishop of Philadelphia, where he established the first diocesan school system in America. 🏫 

Like St. Elizabeth Ann Seton, whose feast we celebrated yesterday, John Neumann was canonized a saint by Pope Paul VI. In the homily for St. John Neumann’s canonization on June 19, 1977, Paul VI spoke of the saint’s immense love for others. ❤️ He said, “His love for people was authentic brotherly love. It was real charity: missionary and pastoral charity. It meant that he gave himself to others. Like Jesus the Good Shepherd, he lay down his life for the sheep, for Christ’s flock: to provide for their needs, to lead them to salvation.” 

St. John Neumann, pray for us so that we might love and serve others in this life as you did! 🙏

“My heart is pierced with sorrow when I hear of the loss of one of my sheep. Lord Jesus, have mercy. Permit not that any one of those whom you have entrusted to me should be lost. O my Jesus, I will pray, fast, suffer, and, with the help of your grace, sacrifice life itself.” 🐑 - St. John Neumann

Getting started or jumping back into prayer? Here are three tips from the saints!

1️⃣ Start small. As St. Gregory the Great said, “You don’t climb a mountain in leaps and bounds, but by taking it slowly.” 🙏 ➡️ Reflect with the Morning Offering on the app (1 min).

2️⃣ Prayer doesn’t need to be perfect. As St. (Pope) John XXIII said, “Prayer is the raising of the mind to God. We must always remember this. The actual words matter less.” 🙏 ➡️ Listen to the Daily Reflection with @jeffcavins and @jonathanroumieofficial (5-10 mins). 

3️⃣ Listen more, talk less. As St. Jane Frances de Chantal said, “In prayer, more is accomplished by listening than by talking.” 🙏 ➡️ Pray the Daily Examen on Hallow (5 mins). 

💥 Check out the Prayer Tips blog for more inspiration via the link in our bio!

Happy Solemnity of the Epiphany! Today the universal Church celebrates the three kings' visit to see the baby Jesus — the first manifestation of Jesus as the Son of God to the Gentiles. He is here with us! 🤍✝️

Often called “Three Kings Day,” 👑 Epiphany is most commonly celebrated in Latin America and Europe. Twelve days after the birth of Jesus, the three kings arrive bearing gifts of frankincense, gold, and myrrh for Him. In many traditions, children leave a pair of shoes out the night before the Epiphany (last night) to receive gifts from the three kings. 

*🇺🇸 In the United States, Holy Mass for the Epiphany of the Lord will be celebrated this Sunday. 

📖😴 To celebrate the Epiphany, listen to a collection of stories with @MarioLopez on the app! (Sleep tab > Bible Stories > Epiphany) 

🙏 “Today the Magi gaze in deep wonder at what they see: heaven on earth, earth in heaven, man in God, God in man, one whom the whole universe cannot contain now enclosed in a tiny body. As they look, they believe and do not question, as their symbolic gifts bear witness: incense for God, gold for a king, myrrh for one who is to die.” - St. Peter Chrysologus

Happy Sunday! 🙏🏼❤️ #stayprayedup #goddid @hallowapp #HallowPartner

Just after the Epiphany, we celebrate the Baptism of the Lord! Tradition holds that Jesus was about thirty years old when he was baptized by John the Baptist — another manifestation of Christ like the Epiphany. 🕊 The Holy Spirit descended upon Him, and Jesus began His ministry. 

📖 When Jesus first approached John about being baptized, John hesitated. As we read in the Gospel of Matthew, ”Then Jesus came from Galilee to John at the Jordan, to be baptized by him. John would have prevented him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?” 

But Jesus insisted. “But Jesus answered him, “Let it be so now; for it is proper for us in this way to fulfill all righteousness.” 

Even though Jesus was born without sin, without any need for repentance, He still asks to be baptized. His baptism demonstrates His desire for our newness in Him, the Son of God. “And a voice from heaven said, ‘This is my Son, the Beloved, with whom I am well pleased.’” 🕊❤️

🙏 Reflect today with a prayer from Pope Francis: “May Jesus, who saved us not for our own merits but in order to realize the immense goodness of the Father, make us merciful toward all.”

“For me, prayer is a surge of the heart; it is a simple look turned toward heaven, it is a cry of recognition and of love, embracing both trial and joy.” ❤️‍🔥 🕊☁️ – St. Thérèse of Lisieux

💭 How do you look simply toward Heaven? 

“In the same way, the Spirit too comes to the aid of our weakness; for we do not know how to pray as we ought, but the Spirit itself intercedes with inexpressible groanings.”🙏🤍 – St. Paul (Romans 8:26)

From the desire of being honored,

“Life is a long lesson in humility.” - James M. Barrie 

✍️ While there were likely earlier versions of the litany, the text that we pray with today is attributed to Cardinal Rafael Merry del Val (1865-1930). Known for his life of piety, he was the Secretary of State to Pope Saint Pius X from 1903 to 1914. 💛

🙏 A - Adoration 
Begin your prayer in adoration and praise of God. Let yourself be filled with wonder at who God is and how He desires to be with you, always. 

🙏 C – Contrition
Next, ask the Holy Spirit to reveal your need for God’s mercy and grace. Name to God particular areas in your life where you seek forgiveness at this time. 

🙏 T – Thankfulness
Spend some time thanking God for the gifts in your life. Try to notice the gifts you often take for granted. 

🙏 S – Supplication
Lastly, lift up your cares and concerns to God. Pray for the people in your life, for those who are suffering, and for the needs of all people throughout the world. 

🕊💛 “I call upon you; answer me, O God. Turn your ear to me; hear my speech.” (Psalm 17:6)

In honor of #MarchforLife tomorrow, we pray with the beautiful Litany for Life. 💛🕊

“Mary, Mother of all Life, help us to respect human life from the moment of conception to the moment of natural death.”

Also known as the Litany of the Blessed Virgin Mary Mother of Life we ask Mary to prayer for our world today and every day. 

Pray the Litany for Life with @LilaRoseOfficial on the app by going to “Featured” on Home or Meditate > Guests > Litany of Mary, Mother of Life. 

🙏 “Remember, o most gracious Virgin Mary, that never was it known that anyone who fled to your protection, implored your help, or sought your intercession was left unaided. Inspired with this confidence, we fly unto you, O Virgin of virgins, our Mother. To you we come, before you we stand, sinful and sorrowful. O Mother of the Word Incarnate, despise not our petitions, but in your mercy hear and answer them. Amen.”🌹❤️

Today is the feast of St. Agnes of Rome! 💛

While we don’t know much about this saint who died a martyr in her early teens, she is known to have beautifully said, 

“Christ has made my soul beautiful with the jewels of grace and virtue. I belong to Him Whom the Angels serve.” 👑💎😇

St. Agnes, pray for us!

"Be at peace." Today we celebrate the feast of St. Francis de Sales, the patron saint of authors, adult education, and the deaf. Did you know that he created a sign language to communicate with his friend Martin? 💛

St. Francis de Sales is most famous for his book Introduction to the Devout Life, which you can listen to as an audiobook on Hallow! 🐝 (On Hallow: Meditate > Audiobooks > Intro to Devout Life)

We pray today with one of his most beautiful prayers: Be at Peace! 😌 (On Hallow: Meditate > Challenges > Saints > Be at Peace.)

🙏 “Do not look forward in fear to the changes and chances of this life. Rather, look to them with full confidence that, as they arise, God, to whom you belong will in His love enable you to profit by them. 

He has guided you thus far in life, and He will lead you safely through all trials; and when you cannot stand it, God will bury you in His arms. 

Do not fear what may happen tomorrow; the same everlasting Father who cares for you today will take care of you then and every day. 

He will either shield you from suffering, or will give you unfailing strength to bear it. Be at peace, then, and put aside all anxious thoughts and imaginations. Amen.” 

St. Francis de Sales, pray for us! 🕊😌

Today we celebrate the Feast of the Conversion of St. Paul the Apostle. 📚⚔️

On the Road to Damascus, we read that Saul, later known as Paul, was struck by lightning and heard Jesus call out to him. 

Jesus said, “Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?” 

Saul asked, “Who are you, Lord?” 

And Jesus replied, “I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting. But get up and enter the city, and you will be told what you are to do.” 

When the lightning striked, Saul became blind for three days. After his baptism, filled with the Holy Spirit, Saul could see once again and began proclaiming that Jesus is the Son of God. 🕊💛

As we reflect on the Daily Gospel today, we pray for all those traveling along their own road to Damascus. May they be filled with the Holy Spirit and experience a transformation of the heart like Paul. 🕊🙏

“Do not lose heart, even if you should discover that you lack qualities necessary for the work to which you are called. He who called you will not desert you, but the moment you are in need he will stretch out his saving hand.” 💛🕊😌

Today is the feast of St. Angela Merici (1474 - 1540), a patron saint of teachers and educators and foundress of the Ursuline Sisters.

Written by the Sr. Faustina Maria Pia, this beautiful Litany of Trust leads us to pray for less self-reliance and more trust in Jesus and His overflowing love for us. ❤️🙏

”From the belief that I have to earn Your love
Deliver me, Jesus.

From the fear that I am unlovable
Deliver me, Jesus.

From the false security that I have what it takes
Deliver me, Jesus.

From the fear that trusting You will leave me more destitute
Deliver me, Jesus.

[…]

That You give me the grace to accept forgiveness and to forgive others
Jesus, I trust in You.

That You give me all the strength I need for what is asked
Jesus, I trust in You.”

Happy feast day, St. Thomas Aquinas! 📚☀️🕊

”Grant me, O Lord my God,
a mind to know you,
a heart to seek you,
wisdom to find you,
conduct pleasing to you,
faithful perseverance in waiting for you,
and a hope of finally embracing you.
Amen.”🙏❤️

A patron saint of students, theologians, philosophers, colleges, and universities, we turn to Aquinas as a guide in seeking to know and love God. 

St. Thomas Aquinas, pray for us!

Pray with Pope Francis on the app! 🙏

There’s not much more exciting than being able to pray with @franciscus! Today we’re overjoyed that you can now pray with Pope Francis on Hallow through his monthly prayer intentions in Spanish or with the English translation. 

🏫 We’ll spend today and tomorrow praying with his intention for January: educators. 

“We pray that educators may be credible witnesses, teaching fraternity rather than competition and helping the youngest and most vulnerable above all.”

⛪️ On Wednesday, we’ll begin praying with his intention for February: parishes.

“Carry your cross on your back and take it as it comes, small or large, whether from friends or enemies and of whatever wood it be made.” - St. John Bosco ✝️

💙 Today is the feast of St. John Bosco (1815 – 1888). Often called “Don Bosco” (Father Bosco in Italian), he is known for his zeal and passion for living his life after Christ. From an early age, he sought to help the poor, sick, youth, and orphans in his community. 

💙 He found much inspiration in St. Francis de Sales, whose feast we celebrated last week. He first opened an oratory for young men named after St. Francis de Sales in Turin, Italy, and later founded the Salesians Order (the Order of St. Francis de Sales). 

💙 St. John Bosco, pray for us and help us to carry our own crosses, whether small or large, whatever they might be made of, so that we might draw near to Him today and every day.

Today we celebrate the Feast of the Presentation of the Lord! Forty days after Christmas, Jesus is presented as the firstborn Son of God — the Light of the World, our Salvation! 🐑

As we hear Simeon say to Mary in the Gospel today, 

“This child is destined for the falling and the rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be opposed so that the inner thoughts of many will be revealed—and a sword will pierce your own soul too.” (Gospel of Luke, Chapter 2)

💜 ”For as in one body we have many members, and not all the members have the same function, so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually we are members one of another. We have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us: prophecy, in proportion to faith; ministry, in ministering; the teacher, in teaching; the exhorter, in exhortation; the giver, in generosity; the leader, in diligence; the compassionate, in cheerfulness.”(Romans 12:4-8) 💜

💜”Deep River” sung by Sr. Thea Bowman (from @PaulineBooksAndMedia)

Check out the new music from Servant of God, Sister Thea Bowman, on Hallow today! We’re so excited to have 15 Spirituals from her album, Songs of My People. 

For Sister Thea, singing was a powerful way to share the message of the hope and joy of the Gospel with a new generation. Listen today and let us know what you think! ⬇️

“Jesus Christ, Lord of all, you see my heart, you know my desires. Possess all that I am. I am your sheep. Make me worthy to overcome the devil.” - St. Agatha 🐑❤️ #FeastDay

“Like my Master I shall die upon the cross.
Like Him, a lance will pierce my heart,
so that my blood and my love,
can flow out upon the land
and sanctify it to His name.”
- St. Paul Miki 

💛 Today, on the Feast of St. Paul Miki and his companions, we remember their sacrifice and martyrdom. 

💛 In 1587, Japanese ruler Toyotomi Hideyoshi banished Catholic missionaries from the country, fearing a threat of foreign invasion. In 1596, he sentenced 26 Christians to death. Among them were Paul Miki and other native Christians and foreign missionaries. 

💛 Tied to their crosses, each was thrust with a lance and killed on February 5th, 1597. St. Paul Miki and his companions became the first martyrs of Japan.

St. Paul Miki & companions, pray for us! 🙏

"Be good, love the Lord, pray for those who do not know him. What a great grace it is to know God!” - St. Josephine Bakhita 🙏 #FeastDay

St. Josephine Bakhita was born in 1869 to a wealthy family in Darfur (now Sudan). Around 7 years old, she was kidnapped from her family and sold into slavery. She survived 12 terrible years of slavery and bore the scars for the rest of her life. 

After being taken to Italy, Josephine was eventually declared free by the Italian court. It was in Italy that she encountered Christ on a crucifix, made her vows as a Canossian Daughter of Charity, and took the name “Josephine.” She was canonized in 2000 by St. (Pope) John Paul II. 🙏

St. Josephine Bakhita, pray for us!

Today we remember and celebrate the first appearance of Our Lady of Lourdes to fourteen-year-old St. Bernadette Soubirous near the grotto of Massabielle in Lourdes, France. 🙏

Beginning on this day in 1858, Mary appeared to St. Bernadette 18 times until July of that same year. In one of her apparitions, Mary encouraged Bernadette to dig near the grotto so that a spring of water would come forth. Since that day, pilgrims from all over the world have journeyed to Lourdes to bathe in its holy waters. 💙💧

Replicas of the Lourdes grotto can be found all over the world, where people often light candles, ask for Our Lady’s prayerful intercession in their lives, and rest peacefully with God. 🕯

We pray with the words of St. John Paul II from his visit to Lourdes in 2004:
”Teach us to build up the world beginning from within: in the depths of silence and prayer, in the joy of fraternal love, in the unique fruitfulness of the Cross. Holy Mary, Mother of believers, Our Lady of Lourdes, pray for us. Amen.” 🕊💙

Before the NFL season kicked off, the kicker for the Kansas City Chiefs, Harrison Butker @buttkicker7, recorded prayers on Faith Under Pressure. In the most important game of the season and coming back from injury, he showed his faith again in the most pressure filled moment of the season, hitting the game winning field goal with time expiring! 🙏❤️

In his meditations on Hallow and post-game interviews, Harrison continues to honor God and giving all the glory to him stating that his faith and God is the most important thing. Before today’s big game, pray with Harrison on the app with meditations on:

🏈 Faith Under Pressure
🏈 Emergency Novena 
🏈 Playing with Joy

“If I didn’t have faith in God, I don’t think I’d be the father I am, the husband I am, the kicker I am.” - Harrison Butker

❤️ “What does love look like? It has the hands to help others. It has the feet to hasten to the poor and needy. It has eyes to see misery and want. It has the ears to hear the sighs and sorrows of men. That is what love looks like.” - St. Augustine

❤️ “The human heart is always drawn by love.” - St. Catherine of Siena

❤️ “Do not forget that true love sets no conditions, it does not calculate or complain, but simply loves.” - St. (Pope) John Paul II

❤️ “Love is a great thing, in fact, the greatest of all, because it lightens every burden and bears every misfortune.” - Thomas à Kempis

#hallowapp #valentinesday #catholicprayer #lovequotes #quotesaboutlove

Almsgiving is one of the 3️⃣ pillars of Lent. It reminds us of Jesus’s call to serve and connect us in solidarity with our brothers and sisters in need. 

Each Saturday in #Pray40, we’ll hear a beautiful reflection and receive a giving challenge for the week to serve and love our neighbors. We can give unto others with our time, gifts, and resources. 🙌

As St. Teresa of Ávila prayed, 

“Christ has no body on earth but ours, no hands but ours, no feet but ours. Our eyes are the eyes through which the compassion of Christ looks out upon the world. Our feet are the feet with which Christ goes about doing good. Our hands are the hands with which Christ blesses His people.” ❣️

#pillarsoflent #lentpillars #giving #giveuntoothers #hallowapp #catholicprayer #catholicmeditation #almsgiving

Fasting is another one of the 3️⃣ pillars of Lent.

While most Catholics are familiar with fasting on Ash Wednesday and Fridays throughout Lent, there are other ways we can fast during the Lenten season. You might consider fasting from things like television, playing video games, or buying coffee in the morning. 🙏 

The ultimate goal of fasting is to remove or diminish the presence of something that we often rely on so that we might better rely on Christ in our daily lives. ❤️ 

Each Friday during Lent #Pray40, we’ll pray alongside @MarkWahlberg. As someone who fasts often, he’s the perfect guide to inspire and challenge us on this pillar of Lent! 💪

“Take courage, friends. Let us go on together. Jesus will be with us. For him we have picked up the cross; for his sake let us continue on.” - Imitation of Christ

#stayprayedup #hallowapp #catholicprayer #catholicmeditation #pillarsoflent #fasting #lent #lentenfast #ashwednesday

The last of the three, but certainly not the least, Lent pillars is PRAYER! 🕊💛

A simple yet powerful prayer to help prepare your heart before Ash Wednesday is the Jesus Prayer:

🙏 “Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner.” 🙏

Join #Pray40 to pray with the Imitation of Christ alongside some amazing guides this Lent! And, if you’re new to prayer, check out hallow.com/how-to-pray for some tips to get started — it’s never too late! 💛

Lent #Pray40 starts tomorrow!! We’re so excited to begin this journey with you and grow closer to Christ together every single day. 🙏

Check out what a few of our members have shared with us about journeying through Pray40: 

💜 “I have never felt closer to God than I did today listening along this Lent.”

💜 “I have been using Hallow for a while now, but it was with the Lent Community that I felt my relationship with God took huge strides forward. This is the closest I have felt to God.”

💜 “Thank you for the Pray40 experience this Lent. I cried hearing the words of God, and these prayers made me and my husband feel like Jesus is with us even when we can’t feel him.”

NEW MUSIC ALERT: An ep of reimagined Hymns, exclusively on @hallowapp ! (Link in profile.) 

St Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) was an Italian Priest who was a Dominican friar, a theologian, philosopher and jurist. He is also considered one of the most influential theologians and philosophers in the Catholic Church. 

Most people dont know he was actually an incredible songwriter as well. In fact, he wrote 5 Hymns about The Eucharist - that is, the gift of the presence of God. At the nudge of the Holy Spirit, I started working on this project - to re approach these hymns with the hope of shining a light on their faith and beauty, not realizing at the time that the US Bishops had devoted the next several years to encourage the people of God to rediscover their sense of wonder about (and faith in) the gift that Communion is. 

A whole lot of love and prayer went into this project, and I’m honored to share it with you this Lent on the #1 prayer app in the world. This new music is perfect to accompany you in prayer, Adoration, or anytime you want to draw near to Jesus this Lenten season and beyond. I’ll talk more about it in the weeks to come :)

On this first Thursday of Lent, we’ll dive even deeper into our weekly theme of humility with a passage from Imitation of Christ and a special reflection from @TheRealJimCaviezel. 

”God protects and delivers the humble. God loves and comforts the humble and draws near to them. God bestows grace on the humble, and after they have been brought low, God raises them up to glory.” (Imitation of Christ)

Reflect in #Pray40 today, and return here to share with us how it went: 

💭 What rests on your heart in prayer today?
💭 What stood out to you in the passage?
💭 How do you feel after the reflection and meditation with Jim?

#StayPrayedUp with @MarkWahlberg on this first Friday of Lent! 🙏⬆️

This week’s fasting challenge is all about doing a little more to get closer to God. ❤️ We promise Mark will inspire you to rely a little less on something temporary in your life and a little more on God each day.

“Do a little more. Give up just a little more. Do something you wouldn’t normally do - wake up a little earlier, work out a little longer, look at your phone a little less, give a little more of yourself to God.” - Friday Fasting Challenge with Mark Wahlberg

Mark encourages us to discern what God is calling us to fast from today. ❤️ Remember, these challenges are between you and God — they aren’t one size fits all! God knows the attachments He wants to free you from. 🙏

#hallowapp #fasting #lentfasting #catholicprayer #catholicmeditation

The Stations of the Cross guide us through fourteen moments on the day Jesus died. Most often prayed on Fridays to remember the day of His death, the Stations create a powerful prayer pilgrimage for us during Lent. ✝️

We reflect today with a powerful passage from the late Pope Benedict XVI on the cross as a sign of God's immense love for us. “The cross speaks to us of the supreme love of God and invites, today, to renew our faith in the power of that love …” 💜

Many churches hold Stations of the Cross each Friday during Lent and sometimes even host “fish fry” dinners to follow. Check with your local parish and see what they’re offering this Lent! 🐟

🙏 You can also pray the Stations of the Cross anytime on the app with @BishopBarron, @JonathanRoumie, @TheRealJimCaviezel, or your favorite Hallow guide. 

#hallowapp #stationsofthecross #stations #fridaystations #lent #pray40

#GivingChallenge Today in Pray40, we’ll reflect on two Corporal Works of Mercy: feed the hungry and give drink to the thirsty. 

The 7️⃣ Corporal Works of Mercy come from Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew (Chapter 25). They tend to the physical needs of our brothers and sisters. 💛

💭 After listening to the session, reflect on how you can attend to your community's needs. What can you do today, tomorrow, and throughout Lent to tend to the body of Christ here on earth? How will you provide for others with your time, gifts, and resources?

🙏“One does not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes forth from the mouth of God.” 🙏

🎧 Have you listened today?

Announcing this week’s #Pray40 themes: Resisting Temptation & Perseverance 💪🪜

Today’s Gospel takes us into the desert with Jesus, where he fasted for forty days and nights — resisting the temptation of the devil and enduring the many difficult weeks preceding His crucifixion and resurrection. ✝️

We read in the Gospel of Matthew:

📖 Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the desert to be tempted by the devil. He fasted for forty days and forty nights, and afterwards he was hungry. The tempter approached and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, command that these stones become loaves of bread.” He said in reply, “It is written: ‘One does not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes forth from the mouth of God.’” 📖 (Matthew 4:1-4)

Join @JonathanRoumieOfficial and over half a million folks praying together worldwide in #Pray40 on this first Monday of Lent! Jonathan will guide us through a meditation on the spiritual life as a battle. As we hear today, there is a battle happening for our souls at all times between God and the devil. 🙏 

Today and throughout the week, we’ll reflect on resisting temptation and growing in perseverance. 🪜💪 These themes were drawn from yesterday’s Gospel reading on Jesus’ Temptation in the Desert. 

🙏“Be strong and courageous of heart as you wait for the Lord.” Do not despair or give up, but offer both soul and body constantly for the glory of God. 🙏 (Imitation of Christ)

💭 Notice what is on your heart today. What challenges is God calling you to face? How can you invite Him into your weaknesses and wounds?

The Follow Me Lent Prayer Challenge leads us through the 8 Beatitudes as a guide for imitating Christ and living as His disciples. 🏜👣

Pope Francis calls the Beatitudes, which come from the Sermon on the Mount, an "ID Card" for Christians — they show us the kind of life that Jesus wants us to lead. 💛

Each week, there’s a saint story, challenge, reflection, and more, all corresponding to the Beatitudes! Check it out today (Meditate > Community > Follow Me: Lent 2023) 🙏💛

Be silent. Pray. 

We imitate Jesus’ habit of solitude so that we might share in the same closeness and intimacy He has with God the Father. 

Take a few minutes to rest in silence today, and allow the Holy Spirit to work through you. 

What do you notice?
What do you feel? 
Out of the noise, what do you hear?

Be silent. Pray. #Pray40

Today is the feast of St. Katharine Drexel (1858-1955). ❤️ 

Foundress of the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament and many missions and schools throughout the United States, St. Katharine Drexel was the second American-born saint to be canonized by the Catholic Church. ✝️

Katharine was passionate about equality and justice and fought against racism throughout her life. Today we remember her words, “If we wish to serve God and love our neighbor well, we must manifest our joy in the service we render to Him and them. Let us open wide our hearts. It is joy which invites us. Press forward and fear nothing.”

Have you listened to the Sunday Reflection on the Transfiguration in #Pray40 today? Pray and learn with @JeffCavins! 🙏

Jeff is the creator of the Great Adventure Bible (the timeline used in Bible In a Year), and he’s also worked closely with @FatherMikeSchmitz on both the Bible In a Year and Catechism In a Year (Ascension Press)! ✝️ 📖

🙏 Listen to Jeff’s powerful reflection:

”This has been the pattern that every Christian has taken upon themselves since the very, very beginning - how do I imitate Christ?” - Jeff Cavins, today in Pray40

#hallowapp #catholicprayer #jeffcavins #transfiguration #reflection #sundayreflection

📣 Announcing this week’s theme: GLORY OF GOD #Pray40

The Gospel today details the narrative of the Transfiguration — when Christ takes three of His disciples up a high mountain and reveals His glory. ☀️

”Six days later, Jesus took with him Peter and James and his brother John and led them up a high mountain, by themselves. And he was transfigured before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became dazzling white. Suddenly there appeared to them Moses and Elijah, talking with him …” 
(Matthew Ch. 17)

In the Scriptures, God frequently reveals himself on mountaintops, in deserted places, in the quiet and unfamiliar. 🏔🏜

As we begin this third week of Lent, consider where God might reveal, or already has revealed, Himself to you! 🙏 We can’t wait to pray with you this week. 

#hallowapp #gospel #sundayreading #homily #gloryofgod #transfiguration

🙏“Praise the Lord, for he is good; for his mercy endures forever; Praise the God of gods; for his mercy endures forever”🙏 #Pray40

“I am not capable of doing big things, but I want to do everything, even the smallest things, for the greater glory of God.” - St. Dominic Savio 

At the young age of 12, St. Dominic Savio joined the Oratory of Turin as a student of St. John Bosco and served his community with humility. Just two years later, he went home to Christ. 🙏

He was canonized in 1954 by St. Pius X, and he continues to stand as a model of holiness for all ages. As St. (Pope) John Paul II reflected years later in 1977, 

"Like Saint Dominic Savio, be missionaries of good example, good words, good action at home, with neighbours and colleagues at work. At every age, we can and we must bear witness to Christ! Commitment to bear witness is permanent and daily.” 💛🕊

“Thank you, every woman, for the simple fact of being a woman! Through the insight which is so much a part of your womanhood you enrich the world's understanding and help to make human relations more honest and authentic.”

We’re still so excited about the new Hallow Course on the Feminine Genius with @LisaAnnCotter, largely based on the teachings of St. John Paul II when he was Pope!

Today’s #WorkofMercy meditation is on Clothing the Naked. 

Consider how you might mirror God’s mercy, forgiveness, and love for others in your community.🪞

💭 How will you clothe others with dignity?

🙏 ”Lord Jesus, … We ask You for the grace that we may mirror Your mercy to those around us, to clothe them by extending forgiveness to them. We also ask Your help to make our hearts be generous and to live by what we need and not by what we want. Amen.” 🙏

In addition to today’s #Pray40, we can also remember the words of Pope Francis in 2016, when he spoke on the Works of Mercy. Pope Francis said, 

“Dear brothers and sisters, let us not fall into the trap of closing in on ourselves, indifferent to the needs of brothers and sisters and concerned only with our own interests. It is precisely in the measure to which we open ourselves to others that life becomes fruitful, society regains peace and people recover their full dignity.”

Today in #Pray40 - “You Make Us New” 💛

Based on today’s Gospel reading on the #WomanAtTheWell, Week 4 of #Pray40 is all about PRAYER! 🙏

As we hear today in John Ch. 4 and throughout Scripture, it is He who satisfies our thirst in this world. 📖 Jesus said to her, “Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again, but those who drink of the water that I will give them will never be thirsty.” 📖 

This week we’ll dive deep into Scripture and the Imitation of Christ to consider what we might substitute in place of spending time with God in prayer and learn how we can instead grow closer to Him. Remember, it’s never too late to jump in! 

#hallowapp #lent #gospelofjohn #prayer #prayerchangesthings

Spend time today with this beautiful poem-prayer written by Mother Teresa in #Pray40 today 🙏💛

”Jesus says:
I thirst for you.
It is true. 
I stand at the door of your heart, day and night. 

Even when you are not listening, 
Even when you doubt it could be Me, 
I am there: 
Waiting for even the smallest signal of your response,
Even the smallest suggestion of an invitation that will permit Me to enter …”

Today is the Feast of St. Patrick, the great “Apostle of Ireland.” ☘️🇮🇪 

In honor of St. Patrick’s feast day, check out the new Irish Prayers on the app, including St. Patrick’s Breastplate Prayer:

“Christ with me, Christ before me, Christ behind me, Christ in me, Christ beneath me, Christ above me, Christ on my right, Christ on my left, Christ when I lie down, Christ when I sit down, Christ in the heart of every man who thinks of me, Christ in the mouth of every man who speaks of me, Christ in the eye that sees me, Christ in the ear that hears me.” ❤️🙏 

This is a beautiful prayer to say in the morning and remind yourself of the strength of Christ that works through you, and of course, an excellent prayer for St. Patrick’s Day. ☘️

This week is all about learning to surrender to Christ every day of our lives. #Pray40 💜🙏

As we enter Week 5, turn to today’s Gospel on the Man Born Blind for a beautiful example of surrendering to Jesus:

📖 As he walked along, he saw a man blind from birth. His disciples asked him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?” Jesus answered, “Neither this man nor his parents sinned; he was born blind so that God’s works might be revealed in him. We must work the works of him who sent me while it is day; night is coming when no one can work. As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.” When he had said this, he spat on the ground and made mud with the saliva and spread the mud on the man’s eyes, saying to him, “Go, wash in the pool of Siloam” (which means Sent). Then he went and washed and came back able to see. 📖 (John 9:1-7)

💭 What areas of your life do you want to surrender to Christ? What’s on your heart as we enter this fifth week of Lent Pray40? ⬇️

#hallowapp #sundayhomily #gospel #gospelreading #surrender #lent

The chorus/refrain of this setting of “Panis Angelicus”  was inspired by a single line of the Latin - “o res mirabilis”
Translated, that means “oh thing miraculous”….another translation I read had the line “oh miracle of miracles!”

In some ways, the refrain is just an exploration of how the maker of miracles Himself became a miracle - 
in His life, His Death and greatest of all, His Resurrection, and now in the Sacramental life of the Church, and the reconciliation of all things. 

@hallowapp

Tomorrow the Church will celebrate the Solemnity of St. Joseph, Spouse of the Blessed Virgin Mary and foster father of Jesus. 🙏

As we read in the Gospels, Joseph was from the line of David – connecting God’s promise in the Old Testament (the old covenant) with His promise in the New Testament (the new covenant, Jesus). Though we never hear from Joseph in the Gospels, we know much about him through what we read about him.

As St. Francis de Sales wrote, “Truly, I doubt not that the angels, wondering and adoring, came thronging in countless multitudes to that poor workshop to admire the humility of him who guarded that dear and divine child, and labored at his carpenter’s trade to support the son and the mother who were committed to his care.” ❤️🕊😌

Consider praying the Litany of St. Joseph tonight or tomorrow to celebrate the Solemnity of St. Joseph! 🙏

🙏 “O Jesus, I surrender myself to you, take care of everything!”🙏

Today with @IlibagizaImmaculee in #Pray40, we pray the Surrender Novena prayer. 

This novena comes from Fr. Dolindo Ruotolo (1882-1970), a Servant of God and candidate for beatification (to become a saint). Jesus revealed to Fr. Dolindo the words that make up this novena. Fr. Dolindo suffered much throughout his life and lived in paralysis for the last ten years. He was also, at one time, the spiritual director and a friend of Padre Pio, who similarly found the love of Christ amidst his suffering.❤️🕊

💭 What can you surrender to Jesus today? 

#hallowapp #surrender #surrendernovena #pray40 #lent

Toward the end of his life, St. Thomas Aquinas was praying fervently, and Jesus spoke to him and said, “You have written well of me, Thomas! What do you desire?”

Thomas could have asked for anything in the world, but he replied, “Non nisi te, Domine.“ 🕊❤️ “Nothing but you, O Lord.” 

💭 How will you respond to Christ in moments of surrender?

Rest with the words of St. Thomas Aquinas in today’s silent meditation. #Pray40

“Each one of you has to be God’s microphone.” - St. Óscar Romero 🎤 #FeastDay

Born in El Salvador in 1917, St. Óscar Romero became the “voice of the voiceless.” When civil war broke out in El Salvador, he spoke out on his radio show and called for the protection of the poor and the marginalized in his homilies. 

On this day in 1980, St. Óscar Romero, who was then an Archbishop, was shot and killed — just one day after he urged soldiers to follow God’s law above their military orders on his radio show. 

St. Óscar Romero, pray for us to use our voices to protect and serve others as you did! ❤️🙏🎤

#hallowapp #stoscarromero #oscarromero #catholicsaint #catholicprayer

Today in #Pray40, @MarkWahlberg guides us to reflect on Job’s powerful story of surrender. Job had everything — family, health, land, wealth — and lost everything. 

”And so today there is no prompt. There is no specific direction. The challenge is to do whatever God is asking you to do. Surrender completely. Ask Him what cross He wants you to carry. Ask Him how He wants you to grow. And then do it.”

💭 ✝️ As we near the end of Lent, where is He calling you to surrender?

#hallowapp #stayprayedup #lent #fasting

Today, on the Solemnity of the Annunciation of the Lord, we celebrate the day the Angel Gabriel announced to Mary that she would bear the Son of God. 🕊😇

📖 The angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. And now, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you will name him Jesus. He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give to him the throne of his ancestor David. He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.” 📖

As you reflect on Mary’s fiat (her “yes”), consider how God is calling you to say “yes” as we near the end of Lent.

Join us for Pray40 Part II: Stations of the Cross, starting Monday. 🙏

Don’t forget to join! Spend these last two weeks of Lent reflecting on the Stations of the Cross to prepare your heart and mind for Christ's Passion and Resurrection in Pray40 Part II, starting tomorrow. 💛

🙏 ”The Way of the Cross is … a school for the examination of conscience, for conversion, for inner transformation and compassion — not as sentimentality, as a mere feeling, but as a disturbing experience that knocks on the door of my heart, that obliges me to know myself and to become a better person.” -Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI 

#hallowapp #pray40 #stationsofthecross

Pray40 Part II: Stations of the Cross starts today! ✝️🙏 Have you joined yet?

An ancient devotion that originated in the Holy Land, the Stations guide us through the fourteen moments of Christ’s Passion. This week and next, we’ll reflect on these moments and meditate on His most loving sacrifice for us. 

“What does it mean to have a part in the Cross of Christ? It means to experience, in the Holy Spirit, the love hidden within the Cross of Christ. It means to recognize, in the light of this love, our own cross.” - St. John Paul II

#hallowapp #stationsofthecross #lent #pray40

Today we begin our journey alongside Christ on His Way to Calvary. #Pray40 ✝️🙏

The First Station: Pilate Condemns Jesus to Die

“If you don’t know how to meditate on high and heavenly things, dwell on the Passion of Christ, and willingly hide in his sacred wounds.” (Imitation of Christ)

The Second Station: Jesus Accepts His Cross

“Why then are you afraid to take up that cross, which leads to the kingdom? In the cross there is salvation; in the cross there is life …” (Imitation of Christ)

If you haven't already, join us in meditating on the Stations of the Cross these final two weeks of Lent in Pray40 Part II. 

#hallowapp #lent #stationsofthecross

Hey friends!! Many of you know that I’ve been leading meditations on the Imitation of Christ on the @hallowapp this Lent in the #Pray40 challenge.

Today we’re meditating on the final #WorkofMercy: Comforting the Afflicted. 🙏😌

As we hear in #Pray40 today, the true meaning of compassion is to “suffer together.” Consider how you can show others true compassion today, throughout Holy Week, and during the Easter season. ❤️

💭 How is the Lord calling you to serve those who are afflicted and suffering?

#hallowapp #lent #compassion #serveothers

“Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest heaven!” #PalmSunday ☀️

Today we remember Christ's entry into Jerusalem after His forty days in the desert. 

Spend some time today resting with the Passion narrative according to the Gospel of Matthew. We’ll hear this same narrative according to the Gospel of John later this week on Good Friday.

Today we resume our meditation on the Stations of the Cross, spending time to reflect on the ninth and tenth moments of His Passion. Consider the immense weight of the Cross on His back as He neared Calvary. #Pray40 🙏✝️

The Ninth Station: Jesus Falls the Third Time

“Look up or look down; look out or look in; and in all directions you will find the cross. And so, it is necessary for you to be patient everywhere, if you wish to have interior peace and merit the eternal crown.” (Imitation of Christ)

The Tenth Station: Jesus Is Stripped of His Garments

“None of us will be able to comprehend heavenly things unless we willingly bear adversities for love of Christ.” (Imitation of Christ)

#hallowapp #stationsofthecross #holyweek #holymonday #lent

“Grant that I may love You always, and then do with me as You will.”🙏

The Eleventh Station: Jesus Is Nailed to the Cross

“I offered my whole self to the Father for you. I gave myself, body and blood for your food, so that I might be all yours and you might be all mine.” (Imitation of Christ)

The Twelfth Station: Jesus Dies On the Cross

“What more do I ask of you than that you try to give yourself over to me completely? Whatever you give me aside from yourself does not interest me because I do not seek your gift, I seek you.” (Imitation of Christ)

Rest today with Christ’s most loving sacrifice for each and every one of us. ✝️❤️

❤️ We’ve followed Jesus through His darkest hours and arrived at the end of His Way of the Cross. 

Spend time resting today with these final moments of His Passion before entering the Sacred Triduum tomorrow. What’s on your heart as you see Jesus taken down from the cross and placed in the sepulcher?🙏 

The Thirteenth Station: Jesus Is Taken Down From The Cross

“Your life is our way, and by means of a holy patience we walk to you, our crown.” (Imitation of Christ)

The Fourteenth Station: Jesus Is Placed in the Sepulcher

“And so all is reduced to the cross, and all consists in dying on it. There is no road that leads to life and to true interior peace except the holy road of the cross and of daily self-denial.” (Imitation of Christ)

“For I have set you an example, that you also should do as I have done to you.” #HolyThursday 

Today’s beautiful liturgy guides us to consider the many ways in which Christ calls us to remember Him, place our trust in Him, and follow His example. Just as He did after the Last Supper, we keep our own vigil with Him as we await His Passion tomorrow and Resurrection on Easter Sunday. ✝️

If you didn’t know, Lent ends at the beginning of tonight’s Evening Mass of the Lord’s Supper, but you can keep praying with us in #Pray40 through Easter Sunday. 🙏

On this day, we remember His most loving sacrifice for each and every one of us on the cross — His Passion. #GoodFriday ✝️🤍

“Grant us, Lord, to carry our cross with love, and to carry our daily crosses in the certainty that they have been enlightened by the dazzling light of Easter. Amen.” - Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI

As you pray today, remind yourself of Christ's immense love for you. How can you become the person He calls you to be? How can you imitate His love for you? 

🙏 Reflect with this prayer from the @daughterstpaul that we hear in #Pray40 today: ”Lord, grant me always to live in preparedness for death. And let me die the death of the just so that I may receive the crown of a life spent wholly for you. Amen.”

#hallowapp #holyweek #carryyourcross #hispassion

Today on Good Friday, we begin the Divine Mercy Novena! 🙏💛

We turn our gaze to the cross and recognize Christ’s most loving sacrifice for every single one of us. Lent is over, and we have dwelled with Him in the desert for weeks, reflecting on His humility, perseverance, and surrender. Starting today, we’ll turn to His endless mercy as we pray through Easter over the next nine days leading up to Divine Mercy Sunday.

If you’ve never prayed a novena or this one in particular, we’ll pray the Divine Mercy Chaplet for the nine days leading up to Divine Mercy Sunday (the Sunday after Easter). As Christ encouraged St. Faustina Kowalska, we’ll pray the chaplet for a different group of people each day — to immerse them in His ocean of mercy. On this first day, we pray for all of humankind. 💙🕊

"Where, if not in the Divine Mercy, can the world find refuge and the light of hope?” - St. (Pope) John Paul II 

We hope you’ll join us in praying this beautiful novena together with @fathermikeschmitz, starting today. 🙏

#divinemercy #divinemercynovena #holyweek #holyweek2023 #jpII #stfaustina

“Awake, O sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give you light.” #HolySaturday

Today, we await Christ’s imminent Resurrection, resting with Him in the darkness. ❤️🙏 

As Pope Francis recently said, “There are moments when life seems to be a sealed tomb: all is dark, and around us we see only sorrow and despair … Jesus tells us that in these moments we are not alone. Precisely in these moments He comes closer than ever to restore life to us.”

Tomorrow, we’ll see the Light. ✝️☀️

Today in Easter with Acts, we reflect on the coming of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost. 🕊🔥 Today’s reflection is both essential and meaningful as we’ll continue to learn how the Holy Spirit moved through the apostles to guide them in proclaiming the Good News all over the world. 🙏

“When the time for Pentecost was fulfilled, they were all in one place together. And suddenly there came from the sky a noise like a strong driving wind, and it filled the entire house in which they were. Then there appeared to them tongues as of fire, which parted and came to rest on each one of them. And they were all filled with the holy Spirit and began to speak in different tongues, as the Spirit enabled them to proclaim.” (Acts 2:1-4)

“God, Your mercy reaches inside
Past the shadows, let there be light
So what was blind can see again
Open my eyes to what is hidden

For by the cross I stand as a testament
You made a better life than the one I left
And if I lose my way or if I forget
You left the empty grave as a monument”

Today in Easter with Acts, we read and reflect on Acts Chapter 5. 🕊️

📖 But Peter and the apostles said in reply, “We must obey God rather than men. The God of our ancestors raised Jesus, though you had him killed by hanging him on a tree. God exalted him at his right hand as leader and savior to grant Israel repentance and forgiveness of sins. We are witnesses of these things, as is the holy Spirit that God has given to those who obey him.” 📖

Repeat this short and powerful prayer to place your trust in Jesus throughout today. “Jesus, I trust in You.” 🕊

Today is the final day of the Divine Mercy Novena. Tomorrow on Divine Mercy Sunday, we’ll celebrate Christ’s most merciful love. ✝️🙏

”Those who sincerely say ‘Jesus, I trust in You’ will find comfort in all their anxieties and fears … There is nothing more man needs than Divine Mercy – that love which is benevolent, which is compassionate, which raises man above his weakness to the infinite heights to the holiness of God.” - St. John Paul II in Krakow, Poland on June 7, 1997

To continue celebrating Jesus’ resurrection, we’re sharing the “Alleluia” of the Mass each Sunday throughout the Easter season! 🙏💛 Tomorrow’s Alleluia draws on John Ch. 20 when the risen Jesus speaks to Thomas, showing him the wounds on His hands and sides from being nailed to the cross. Jesus tells Thomas, “Do not be unbelieving, but believe.” (John 20: 27)

”You believe in me, Thomas, because you have seen me, says the Lord; blessed are they who have not seen me, but still believe!”

🙌 Alleluia, alleluia! 🙌

#hallowapp #alleluia #heisrisen #doubtingthomas

Today is Divine Mercy Sunday! Today we remember and celebrate Jesus’ revelation of the Chaplet to St. Faustina and that His love is, and always will be, greater than our sins. ❤️🕊️

In the year 2000 on the day of St. Faustina’s canonization, St. John Paul II (then Pope) declared the second Sunday of Easter this holy day of the Divine Mercy. He said, “Divine Mercy reaches human beings through the heart of Christ crucified.” ✝️ In His sacrifice for each and every one of us on the cross, Jesus carries our burdens, forgives us, and offers us endless mercy.

Pray the Divine Mercy Chaplet on Hallow today or spend some time with us right now to pray its closing prayer: 

“Eternal God, in whom mercy is endless and the treasury of compassion inexhaustible, look kindly upon us and increase your mercy in us, that in difficult moments we might not despair nor become despondent, but with great confidence submit ourselves to Your holy will, which is Love and Mercy itself.” 🙏

#hallowapp #divinemercysunday #divinemercy #divinemercychaplet #stfaustina

“If one dream should fall and break into a thousand pieces ... never be afraid to pick one of those pieces up and begin again. That’s the beauty of being alive ... We can always start all over again. Enjoy God’s amazing opportunities bestowed on us. Have faith in Him always.” 💙😌
 
St. Bernadette Soubirous, pray for us! #FeastDay 🕊

On February 11th, 1858, Bernadette was collecting firewood by a stream when suddenly there was a rush of wind. From the nearby grotto appeared a dazzling young woman, who would appear to her 18 times over several weeks. Over the course of these apparitions, a spring of healing waters emerged from the ground, and the woman requested that a chapel be built there. The woman eventually revealed herself as the “Immaculate Conception” — Our Lady of Lourdes.

Much of our journey through Acts thus far has focused on the power of the Holy Spirit in the lives of the Apostles. As we hear Dr. Hahn reflect today, “The Holy Spirit was the air that the early church breathed. This was the power that was not merely human, but divine.” 🕊💜

💭 Consider a time or season in your life when you felt the Holy Spirit moving you toward a decision or understanding. What was it like?

💭 What did you learn from today’s session on Acts Chapter 8? Was this story of Phillip and the eunuch powerful for you in prayer today?

#EasterWithActs Recap! 💜 📖

Are you journeying through the Acts of the Apostles with us in the Easter Challenge? It’s never too late to jump in and listen to some of the incredible reflections by Dr. Scott Hahn on this book of the Bible. 

Here are some lessons we’ve learned thus far from this powerful Bible Study with @JonathanRoumie and @ScottwHahn:

1. Acts of the Apostles ➡️ Acts of the Holy Spirit.🕊

2. The gift we pray for is the Holy Spirit’s transformation of our hearts and lives. ❤️

3. Sharing the Good News begins with ourselves and can happen one person at a time with God’s love. ✝️

#hallowapp #easter #actsoftheapostles #biblestudy #goodnews

Happy Feast of St. Anselm of Canterbury (1033-1109)!

Through “faith seeking understanding,” St. Anselm made significant contributions to philosophical theology. He served as an Abbot in France and later as the Archbishop of Canterbury in England. He was exiled twice by Kings William II and Henry I, but he continued writing theological works and working for justice in the Church. St. Anselm is considered a Doctor of the Church for his theological contributions. 📖✍️

Reflect today with this excerpt from a beautiful prayer of surrender and discernment written by St. Anselm: 

🙏 ”Look upon us, Lord; hear us, enlighten us, show yourself to us. Give yourself to us that it may be well with us, for without you it goes so ill for us. Have pity upon our efforts and our strivings towards you, for we can avail nothing without you. Teach me to seek you, and reveal yourself to me as I seek, because I can neither seek you if you do not teach me how, nor find you unless you reveal yourself. Let me seek you in desiring you; let me desire you in seeking you; let me find you in loving you; let me love you in finding you.”

Today: ACTS 12 #EasterWithActs🙏

“Christ is fulfilling the Old Testament by establishing the new. He’s the new Moses. He’s bringing about a new Passover, a new covenant and a new law. Not abolishing the old, but fulfilling it.” - Dr. Scott Hahn

Join the waitlist: St. Joseph Consecration!

Starting on May 1, the Feast of St. Joseph the Worker, we’ll begin this new challenge and consecration with the amazing Sr. Miriam James Heidland! 🙏

St. Joseph truly teaches us how to care for and love others humbly as the foster father of Jesus and the spouse of Mary. We’re so excited to deepen our prayer alongside him this May!❤️ ✝️

We’ll share more about the consecration this week, but in the meantime, don’t forget to join the waitlist in the app!

Today is the Feast of St. Mark the Evangelist! 📖

Some scholars believe the Gospel of Mark was the first Gospel written and that the text was recorded by listening to St. Peter. 

💭 🦁Did you know St. Mark is often depicted as a winged lion? 

To celebrate this feast day, listen and pray with this beautiful meditation on the Calming of the Storm at Sea in today’s #DailySaint. 🙏This passage demonstrates Jesus’ divinity, one of the common themes in Mark’s Gospel. 

“Who then is this whom even wind and sea obey?” (Mark 4:41) 🌊 ✝️

We’re so excited about the upcoming St. Joseph Consecration! 🙏 

We know you might have a few questions before we begin, so we put together this short guide to understanding this Consecration to Jesus through St. Joseph:

💭 What is a consecration? 

A consecration to a saint is actually a consecration to Jesus Himself through that saint. Together, for 21 days, we’ll entrust ourselves to God through the care of St. Joseph. 

💭 Why St. Joseph? 

In his many roles, St. Joseph is a beautiful example of holiness, humility, and many other virtues for each of us. 

💭 Why consecrate ourselves to St. Joseph?

Ultimately, we draw near to St. Joseph to draw near to his son Jesus and deepen our love for Him.

Today in Easter with Acts: Chapter 18 🙏

@ScottWHahn draws our attention today to the importance of friendship in the early Church’s evangelization efforts and that true friendship is born out of our communal belonging to Christ. As we hear Dr. Hahn explain today, 

💜 “When Paul comes to Ephesus, Apollos goes to Corinth to assist in the mission that Paul himself started there. Now, we realize in First Corinthians that there were Partisan factions in Corinth. You know, I planted Apollo’s water, but God gave the growth is how Paul resolved the issue. In other words, we’re not followers of Paul or Cepheus, or Apollos. We all belong to Christ. That is the soil in which Christian friendship flourishes.”

💭 If you’re journeying with us in the Easter with Acts Challenge, what stood out to you in today's reflection? 

#hallowapp #actsoftheapostles #apostlepaul #friendship #christianfriendship

Today is the Feast of St. Gianna Beretta Molla (1922-1962), the patron saint of mothers, physicians, and unborn children. 

A wife, mother, and doctor, St. Gianna developed a tumor before her fourth pregnancy and passed away after giving birth to her daughter Gianna Emanuela. On the day of her canonization in 2004, St. (Pope) John Paul II said, “Gianna Beretta Molla was a simple, but more than ever, significant messenger of divine love.” ❤️🙏 Her daughter continues her mother’s legacy and practices pediatrics today. 

St. Gianna, pray for us. 

We know of the difficulties so many endure today in childbirth and the cross of infertility that so many bear silently. We invite you to pray with the Infertility and Child Loss and Grief Prayer Collections on Hallow. 💜

Happy Feast of St. Catherine of Siena!🙏❤️

One of four female Doctors of the Church, St. Catherine of Siena is known for her writings on mysticism and spiritual guidance and her efforts for Church unity in the fourteenth century. ✍️

Reflect with this beautiful prayer, written by St. Catherine of Siena, to celebrate her feast day: ”Holy Spirit, come into my heart; Draw it to Thee by Thy power, O my God, And grant me charity with filial fear. Preserve me, O beautiful love, from every evil thought; Warm me, inflame me with Thy dear love, And every pain will seem light to me. My Father, my sweet Lord, help me in all my actions. Jesus, love. Jesus, love. Amen.” ❤️ 🕊

“In every way I have shown you that by hard work of that sort we must help the weak, and keep in mind the words of the Lord Jesus who himself said, ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.’” (Acts 20:35) 🙏 ❤️

💭 What were your takeaways from Paul’s speech in today’s reading from Acts Ch. 20? 

💭 What do you think of his approach to encouraging his listeners (and us) to spread the Good News?

”We are so often prone to criticism. Paul gives us a better approach. Read Philippians 4:8 … If there’s anything true, if there’s anything good, if there’s anything worthy of praise, think on these things. And why? Because that’s what God does with us. He affirms us. He builds us up. He forgives us, and he fills us with the Holy Spirit.” - Dr. Scott Hahn 🕊

It’s Day 1 of the St. Joseph Consecration with Sr. Miriam James Heidland! 

It’s so special to begin this consecration on the Feast of St. Joseph the Worker, a day on which we recognize Joseph as a carpenter and guardian of the Holy Family! This first week of the consecration is all about rediscovering Joseph as an ordinary man thrown into extraordinary circumstances as the husband of Mary and the earthly father of Jesus.

We can’t wait to begin this journey with you! ❤️ Have you prayed Day 1 yet? 🙏

#hallowapp #stjoseph #stjosephconsecration #stjosephtheworker

Feast Day: St. Joseph the Worker! ❤️🙏

✝️ We shared earlier how special this day is for us to begin our consecration to Jesus through St. Joseph. This feast commemorates St. Joseph as someone who most gracefully integrated spiritual life with his daily, laborious life as a father, husband, and worker. His life is such a beautiful example for us to follow God’s purpose every day. 

🙏 ”Saint Joseph reminds us that those who appear hidden or in the shadows can play an incomparable role in the history of salvation.” - Pope Francis

🙏 “The same aura of silence that envelops everything else about Joseph also shrouds his work as a carpenter in the house of Nazareth. It is, however, a silence that reveals in a special way the inner portrait of the man.” - St. John Paul II

💭 Did you know that Joseph is the patron saint of the Church?

”And people were bringing children to him that he might touch them, but the disciples rebuked them. When Jesus saw this he became indignant and said to them, “Let the children come to me; do not prevent them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. Amen, I say to you, whoever does not accept the kingdom of God like a child will not enter it.” Then he embraced them and blessed them, placing his hands on them.” (Mark 10:13-16)

While we’re journeying through the St. Joseph Consecration on the app this month, May is also the #MonthofMary! ❤️ The Church has recognized the Month of Mary for centuries, turning to Our Lady as a guide to better know and love her Son, Jesus. 

Throughout the month, we’ll highlight a few different Marian prayers here — all of which can be prayed on the app! Today, take some time to pray the #Memorare. This beautiful prayer is commonly attributed to St. Bernard of Clairvaux and is a prayer of intercession (meaning we ask Mary to pray for us and to take what’s on our hearts to Christ). 

🙏 ”Remember, O most gracious Virgin Mary, that never was it known that anyone who fled to thy protection, implored thy help, or sought thine intercession, was left unaided. Inspired by this confidence I fly unto thee, O Virgin of virgins, my Mother. To thee do I come, before thee I stand, sinful and sorrowful. O Mother of the Word Incarnate, despise not my petitions, but in thy mercy hear and answer me. Amen.”🙏

Acts of the Apostles, Ch. 26 🙏

”Brothers and sisters, what we can do in applying this kind of truth is to ask our Lord to enkindle in our hearts, such a fire of divine love that not only do we love God above all things, but we love our neighbors as ourselves for the love of Christ that we would do anything to bring the truth of Christ and the Gospel to our family members, to our neighbors, to our friends, to our fellow parishioners who may have wandered off.” - Dr. Scott Hahn

Mary’s Magnificat ❤️🙏🕊

“My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord; my spirit rejoices in God my savior.”

This beautiful song of praise is found in the Gospel of Luke when Mary visits her cousin Elizabeth, who is pregnant with John the Baptist (Luke 1:46-55). 

We'll celebrate this encounter between Mary and Elizabeth on the Feast of the Visitation in a few weeks on May 31. In the meantime, we invite you to pray the Magnificat with us.

“Open your little heart to that breadth of love by which the Father gave us his Son, and with him gave us himself, and the Holy Spirit, and all things besides.” - St. John of Ávila ❤️ 🕊 #FeastDay

In his life, St. John of Ávila was a popular spiritual director and shared close friendships with many saints, including St. Teresa of Avila and St. Ignatius of Loyola. He was proclaimed a Doctor of the Church for pioneering the universal call to holiness and for further developing priestly spirituality.

”John of Avila was a contemporary, friend and counselor of great saints, and one of the most celebrated and widely esteemed spiritual masters of his time.” - Pope Benedict XVI

Today is Ascension Thursday, the 40th day of Easter, on which we celebrate Jesus’ Ascension into Heaven! ✝️❤️

“And behold, I am with you always, until the end of the age.” (Matthew 28:20) 

Many dioceses around the world will celebrate the Ascension this coming Sunday, the seventh Sunday of Easter. Save this post to celebrate and pray with the Gospel on Sunday as well. 🙏

“Today our Lord Jesus Christ ascended into heaven; let our hearts ascend with him. Listen to the words of the Apostle: If you have risen with Christ, set your hearts on the things that are above where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God; seek the things that are above, not the things that are on earth. For just as he remained with us even after his ascension, so we too are already in heaven with him, even though what is promised us has not yet been fulfilled in our bodies.” - St. Augustine of Hippo

“Behold, your mother.” (John 19:27) 🙏💛

Instituted in 2018 by @franciscus, the Memorial of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of the Church, harkens back to the Gospel of John, in which we hear Jesus instruct his disciple John to behold Mary as his mother. 

Mary, Mother of God and Mother of the Church, pray for us.

#hallowapp #memorialoftheblessedvirginmary

“Most blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb. And how does this happen to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? For at the moment the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the infant in my womb leaped for joy. Blessed are you who believed that what was spoken to you by the Lord would be fulfilled.” 🕊💛 #TheVisitation

Today we celebrate Mary’s visit to her cousin Elizabeth when both of them were expecting. It was also the first meeting of Jesus and John the Baptist!

❤️🙏 As we begin our 30-day journey through all 150 psalms, we hope you’ll take the time to slow down and notice how God might be speaking to you through the Psalms this summer. Today, reflect, rest, and pray with Psalms 1-5, taking them on as your own to grow closer to Him.

”In the Psalms are expressed and interwoven with joy and suffering, the longing for God and the perception of our own unworthiness, happiness and the feeling of abandonment, trust in God and sorrowful loneliness, fullness of life and fear of death. The whole reality of the believer converges in these prayers…” - Pope Benedict XVI

Today on the Solemnity of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, the free 12-Day Sacred Heart Prayer Challenge starts as we answer the Bishops’ call to prayer. ❤️🙏

This past Tuesday, the USCCB, alongside Archbishop José Gomez of Los Angeles, called us all to prayer as a professional baseball team decides to honor a group today that heartbreakingly disrespects and mocks our Lord, His Mother, religious sisters, and our faith. Together we’ll pray the Litany of the Sacred Heart and so much more guided by Trevor Williams, Catholic husband, father, and one of the only major league baseball players to courageously speak out about these heartbreaking events. @mellamotrevor.

“While I know that it’s easy to be frustrated, hurt, and disappointed by this situation and so many others in our culture, the Sacred Heart of Jesus also reminds us of Jesus’ burning love for mankind. May we pray for the harm being done and that all people would experience Jesus’ overwhelming love for them, no matter who they are.” - Trevor Williams

Let’s pray together today that our hearts and our world might be conformed to Jesus’ most Sacred Heart.

Today is the Solemnity of the Nativity of St. John the Baptist! 🙏“Behold, I am sending my messenger ahead of you; he will prepare your way before you.”🙏

Did you know that Mary and John the Baptist are the only two saints given the distinction of having liturgical celebrations for their births? The Church recognizes that their lives are entirely oriented to Christ and prepared for His coming.❤️

💭 Reflect today with this quote from Pope Benedict XVI on this day in 2012:

“Today, 24 June, we are celebrating the Solemnity of St. John the Baptist. He is the only saint — with the exception of the Virgin Mary — whose birth the liturgy celebrates and it does so because it is closely connected with the mystery of the Incarnation of the Son of God. In fact, from the time when he was in his mother’s womb John was the precursor of Jesus: the Angel announced to Mary his miraculous conception as a sign that “nothing is impossible to God” (Lk 1:37), six months before the great miracle that brings us salvation, God’s union with man brought about by the Holy Spirit.” - Pope Benedict XVI, Angelus 2012

#hallowapp #johnthebaptist

“Let me stress this point: it is in the simplicity of your ordinary work, in the monotonous details of each day, that you have to find the secret, which is hidden from so many, of something great and new: Love.” - St. Josemaría Escrivá #FeastDay

Born in 1902 in Barbastro, Spain, St. Josemaría Escrivá was raised in a devout Catholic family. He received deep faith in his youth, though his faith was tried when three of his sisters died, and his family experienced financial hardship.

He went on to become a priest, and while carrying out his pastoral duties, he received a heavenly vision that inspired him to found an international lay organization called Opus Dei, which means the “work of God.” 🙏

St. Josemaría Escrivá is today known as the “saint of ordinary life” for his passion and encouragement for all people to pursue holiness in daily work and prayer.

❤️ In honor of his feast day, share with us how you seek to love God and others daily! ⬇️

Today is the Solemnity of Saints Peter and Paul! ❤️ Tradition holds that Peter and Paul were martyred around the same time under the regime of Emperor Nero, which is why we celebrate their feasts together today, on June 29. 

In honor of this solemnity, spend some time with today’s reading from the Gospel of John: 

Jesus said to Simon Peter, “Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?”He said to him, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.” He said to him, “Feed my lambs.” He then said to him a second time, “Simon, son of John, do you love me?” He said to him, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.” He said to him, “Tend my sheep.” He said to him the third time, “Simon, son of John, do you love me?” Peter was distressed that he had said to him a third time, “Do you love me?” and he said to him, “Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you.” Jesus said to him, “Feed my sheep.”

🙏 "Follow me."

🙏 "Feed my sheep."

💭 Pause for a minute and listen to today's Gospel reading on Jesus healing a man with leprosy with Truth & Life. 

”I will. Be clean.” #GospelofMatthew

#hallowapp

“My Lord and my God.” ❤️🙏 #FeastDay

Rather than criticizing Thomas’ doubt, we can see how Jesus reveals Himself to us when we struggle to believe or do not understand. For it was to Thomas also that Jesus revealed Himself as the “the Way, and the Truth, and the Life” (Jn. 14:6).

“The faithlessness of Thomas aids us in our belief more than does the faith of the disciples who believed... When he is brought to believe by feeling with his own hand, every doubt having been removed, our own mind is confirmed in faith.” - St. Gregory the Great

💭 When has Jesus revealed Himself to you, just as He did to Thomas? When have you doubted but then been led to believe?

Happy Fourth of July! 

“Christ the Lord has called us out of darkness into his marvelous light. Let us turn to him in humble but fervent petition, seeking the grace to root out from our hearts all trace of darkness, and all that holds us back from walking in the full freedom of the children of God. As Christ is our great model for that inner freedom, which enables us to do the right, let us turn to him with confidence that we, too, may follow him to the fullness of spiritual freedom.” @USCCB

“Gracious and holy Father, please give me: intellect to understand you; reason to discern you; diligence to seek you; wisdom to find you; a spirit to know you; a heart to meditate upon you; ears to hear you; eyes to see you; a tongue to proclaim you; a way of life pleasing to you; patience to wait for you; and perseverance to look for you.

Today is the Feast of St. Benedict! Born around 480 A.D. in the province of Nursia, Italy, St. Benedict is known as the father of Western monasticism. 

Seeking to glorify God, Benedict decided to live as a hermit, and others soon joined him. He eventually gathered these men into twelve monasteries and wrote his Rule for monks, known as the “Rule of St. Benedict.” 

📖 Benedict’s Rule provides a vision of monastic life and spirituality that encourages liturgical prayer, manual labor, study, and communal living. The Rule famously begins, “Listen, my son, to the Master’s instructions and attend to them with the ear of your heart.”👂❤️ Today, consider how you listen and attend to others with the ear of your heart. 

St. Benedict’s legacy lives on in the Benedictine and Cistercian orders and in the way his Rule has shaped the lives of monks and religious around the world. 

#hallowapp #stbenedict #ruleofstbenedict

“We're made for relationship – friendship with God and friendship with each other. This is extremely important right now. Because this might be the loneliest generation of all time. Maybe, you might count yourself among that number right now. And if you are, and hear this, please: God made you for friendship. He made you for love. 

He's inviting you even now at this very moment to turn to Him, to ask Him to show Himself to you. To ask Him to reveal your own identity to yourself. To know your goodness. That you don't just happen to be here, but He very intentionally brought you into existence. Because He wants to invite you into friendship.”

 - Fr. John Riccardo @acts.xxix

“All of us must be saints in this world. Holiness is a duty for you and me. So let's be saints and so give glory to the Father.” - Mother Teresa

“By you, O Mary, the erring are brought back to the right road and heaven is filled. Thus your most powerful and merciful charity is poured over us like a compassionate and helpful love.” ❤️

Mt. Carmel lies on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea, and it’s the site where, in the Book of Kings, the Prophet Elijah defends faith in the one true God. 

A group of monks in the 11th century sought to follow Elijah’s example and settled on Mt. Carmel to pray. 🙏 They dedicated themselves to Mary and took their name as the Brothers of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel. This led to the formation of the Carmelite Order. 

On this day in 1251, Mary appeared to another Carmelite, St. Simon Stock, and entrusted him with the devotion of the brown scapular to give to all Christians a sign of her protection and help.

⛰️💛 Our Lady of Mount Carmel, pray for us and guide us to your Son, Jesus!

“The saints are like the stars. In His providence, Christ conceals them in a hidden place that they may not shine before others when they might wish to do so. Yet they are always ready to exchange the quiet of contemplation for the works of mercy as soon as they perceive in their heart the invitation of Christ.” - St. Anthony of Padua

Today is the Feast of St. Mary Magdalene!

Reflect today on Jesus’ appearance to Mary Magdalene after His Resurrection. She was the first person he appeared to — the first eyewitness.

“I have seen the Lord.” ✝️

For this reason, Mary Magdalene is often called the “Apostle to the Apostles.” She was the first to declare the Good News to Jesus' disciples after seeing Him risen from the tomb. 🙏❤️

We cannot wait to begin our journey through the life of this incredible follower and friend of Jesus alongside @ElizabethTabish in our first week of Saints in 7 Days, starting Monday!

#hallowapp

Today is the 3rd World Day of Grandparents and the Elderly, and on Wednesday, we’ll celebrate the feast day of Saints Joachim and Anne, the parents of Mary and grandparents of Jesus. ❤️ This year’s theme, selected by Pope Francis, is “His mercy is from age to age,” harkening back to Mary and her older relative Elizabeth at the Visitation. (Lk 1:50)

Pope Francis has also encouraged all young people attending World Youth Day to visit with and pray for their grandparents and the elderly before traveling: 

🙏❤️ “To you, the young who are preparing to meet in Lisbon or to celebrate World Youth Day in your own countries, I would ask: before you set out on your journey, visit your grandparents or an elderly person who lives alone! Their prayers will protect you and you will carry in your heart the blessing of that encounter." - @franciscus

#hallowapp #worldyouthday #wyd #lisboa2023

Have you prayed Day 1 of Saints in 7 Days with Mary Magdalene alongside our incredible guide @ElizabethTabish yet? 😇❤️

🙏 Today on Day 1, we begin our journey learning about Mary Magdalene’s identity as Mary from the town of Magdala, situated on the Sea of Galilee. 🎧 Listen here with us for a sneak peek into one of this week’s beautiful meditations from @ElizabethTabish. 

💭 What are you most looking forward to about this series?

#hallowapp #marymagdalene #saints #catholicsaints

Reflect today on what life on the road with Jesus would have looked like if you were Mary Magdalene:

Your life has been radically changed by Jesus, and now you’re with Him each day. You’re being prepared for an incredible role to sit at the foot of the cross as He passes and also to be the first witness to His Resurrection. ✝️🙏❤️

Imagine you’ve journeyed with Him to this moment where a crowd has gathered in Galilee. ✨ Jesus said, “No one lights a lamp and hides it in a clay jar or puts it under a bed. Instead, they put it on a stand, so that those who come in can see the light.”✨ 

What have you learned so far in #Saintsin7Days with Mary Magdalene? 

#hallowapp #marymagdalene

Let’s pray for all those making a pilgrimage to World Youth Day and other holy places this summer. 🙏❤️

“To go in a spirit of prayer from one place to another, from one city to another, in the area marked especially by God's intervention, helps us not only to live our life as a journey, but also gives us a vivid sense of a God who has gone before us and leads us on, who himself set out on man's path, a God who does not look down on us from on high, but who became our traveling companion.” - St. Pope John Paul II

@lisboa2023_en

#hallowapp #worldyouthday #wyd #lisboa2023

📣 “Mary arose and went with haste.” (Luke 1:39) #WorldYouthDay

The 2023 World Youth Day theme draws us back to the Visitation when Mary visits her cousin Elizabeth right after the Annunciation. Pope Francis reflected, “Mary could have focused on herself and her own worries and fears about her new condition. Instead, she entrusted herself completely to God. Her thoughts turned to Elizabeth. She got up and went forth, into the world of life and movement.”

This stirring in Mary’s heart to go out and share the Good News is “an image of the pilgrim Church, a Church that goes forth for service, a Church that brings the good news to all!” (Pope Francis)

As you prepare your heart for World Youth Day or pray for all those attending, consider how you might emulate Mary’s haste — her quickness to share the Good News with her cousin Elizabeth. 🙏❤️

📣 Announcing our next Saints in 7 Days … St. Ignatius of Loyola with incredible guide @jonathanroumieofficial!

From founding the Jesuit Order to creating the Examen prayer method, St. Ignatius is one of the most famous saints in the history of the Church, and his path to sainthood is nothing short of unique. 

Whether or not you were able to join the Mary Magdalene challenge, join the St. Ignatius challenge waitlist today and get ready for another week of Saints in 7 Days, starting Monday! 😇

I promise you’ll find this saint’s life beyond inspiring. 

#hallowapp #saintsin7days #stignatius #ignatiusofloyola

Today we celebrate the feasts of Saints Martha, Mary, and Lazarus. These three siblings resided in the town of Bethany, near Jerusalem. 

💭 Reflect today with this passage from the Gospel of Luke contrasting Martha and her sister Mary when Jesus is with them. 

📖 Martha, burdened with much serving, came to him and said, “Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me by myself to do the serving? Tell her to help me.” The Lord said to her in reply, “Martha, Martha, you are anxious and worried about many things. There is need of only one thing. Mary has chosen the better part and it will not be taken from her.” 📖 (Luke 10:38-42)

Jesus encourages Martha to slow down when we’re in His presence and take the time for prayer and reflection. While it can feel like we have so much to do, always rushing from one thing to another, He asks us to be like Mary at times — to simply sit and listen.👂❤️🙏

#hallowapp #catholicsaints #feastday

In tandem with the World Youth Day 2023 theme “Mary arose and went with haste” (Luke 1:39), the Official Prayer for WYD calls on the intercession of Mary, Our Lady of the Visitation. ❤️🌎

Those attending World Youth Day or those joining in prayer are invited to pray this beautiful pilgrims’ prayer from @lisboa2023_en:

🙏 “Our Lady of the Visitation, you who left in haste towards the mountain to meet Elizabeth, lead us also to meet all those who await us to deliver them the living Gospel: Jesus Christ, your Son and our Lord! We will go in a hurry, with no distraction or delay, but with readiness and joy. We will go peacefully, because those who take Christ take peace, and welldoing is the best wellbeing. Our Lady of the Visitation, with your inspiration, this World Youth Day will be the mutual celebration of the Christ we take, as You once did. Make it a time of testimony and sharing, fraternization, and giving thanks, each of us looking for the others who always wait. With you, we will continue on this path of gathering, so that our world will gather as well, in fraternity, justice and peace. Help us, Our Lady of the Visitation, to bring Christ to everyone, obeying the Father, in the love of the Spirit!”🙏

😇 DAY 1: St. Ignatius of Loyola with @jonathanroumieofficial #Saintsin7Days

The patron saint of soldiers and retreats, we’re so excited for you to learn about St. Ignatius’ unique path to sainthood and how his life and legacy of the Jesuit Order continue to impact the Church. #AMDG

We begin today with the cannonball that changed everything — pray Day 1 of this new Saints in 7 Days series with us today! 💥

🙏 “Act as though everything depended on you, and pray as if everything depended on God.” - St. Ignatius of Loyola 

#hallowapp #stignatius

The prayer of the daily Examen originated in the sixteenth century when St. Ignatius of Loyola began writing the Spiritual Exercises. St. Ignatius believed this prayer method would help us develop discipline, ask for God’s grace, and see how God works through us and among us daily.

”Speak little, listen much.” - St. Ignatius of Loyola

1️⃣ Turn your attention to God. 

2️⃣ Take a moment to recall what you’re most grateful for today.

3️⃣ Now, walk through your day.

4️⃣ Sit for some time in silence with God. 

5️⃣ Turn your attention to tomorrow.

6️⃣ Gently open your eyes.

💭 ❤️🙏 

Pray the Examen every day with us on Hallow!

📣😇 Next Up: St. Gianna Molla #Saintsin7Days 

St. Gianna Molla is most known for her loving, heroic sacrifice of her life for the birth of her daughter Gianna Emanuela. Her life is truly a testament to following God’s will, and I promise you’ll find this next Saint in 7 Days series deeply powerful and inspiring to live out your own vocation. ❤️

🙏 “Jesus, I promise You to submit myself to all that You permit to befall me, make me only know Your will.” - St. Gianna Molla 

Join the waitlist for this next Saints in 7 Days series, starting Monday.

#hallowapp #stgiannamolla

Today we remember the Transfiguration of Jesus when he brought apostles Peter, James, and John up to a high mountain, which many believe to have been Mount Tabor. ⛰️☀️ There, Jesus was transfigured, and prophets Moses and Elijah appeared before them, conversing with Jesus. 

✝️ And then God spoke from above, saying, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him.” After God spoke, Jesus told Peter, James, and John: “Rise, and do not be afraid.” The Catechism guides us to understand that Jesus’ message aims to strengthen the faith of His apostles before His passion and resurrection (CCC 568). 

Yet His message is also for us — to rise and not be afraid, to follow Him wholeheartedly and trust in His love for us. ❤️🙏

💭 Have you ever journeyed up a mountain, a challenging ascent, only to better trust in God’s plan for you? When have you had a glimpse into God’s Kingdom such that you can rise and be not afraid?

#hallowapp #transfiguration #mounttabor

Jesus told Peter, James, and John to “Rise, and do not be afraid” atop Mount Tabor after His transfiguration (Matthew 17:7). ⛰️☀️

🙏 This is a charge to us, too, especially for everyone who participated in World Youth Day, making the pilgrimage — the ascent — to see Christ. 

We’d love to invite you to join us in praying the World Youth Day Novena on the app starting today. No matter your type of participation in World Youth Day, this is a beautiful way to conclude your pilgrimage by reflecting on your journey and where God is calling you next. 🚗🚌✈️⛵️🚶‍♀️

❤️ As St. Thérèse of Lisieux said, “Let us see life as it really is … it is a moment between two eternities.”

Here’s a breakdown of the novena: 

Day 1 - Leaving the Mountain Top
Day 2 - Pilgrim Journey 
Day 3 - Call to Holiness
Day 4 - Growing in Virtue 
Day 5 - Servant Heart
Day 6 - Missionary Spirit 
Day 7 - Sacramental Life
Day 8 - Do Not Be Afraid
Day 9 - An Invitation

#hallowapp #worldyouthday #worldyouthday2023 #wyd #lisbon

Today we begin our journey through the life of St. Gianna Molla in our newest Saints in 7 Days challenge! 😇❤️🙏“Love and sacrifice are closely linked, like the sun and the light. We cannot love without suffering and we cannot suffer without love.” St. Gianna Molla is best known for the heroic decision to save the life of her daughter, Dr. Gianna Emanuela Molla, but her desire to follow God’s will and live a holy life began much earlier in her life. Her ultimate sacrifice of love is something only a mother can make, though I promise everyone can learn from her surrender to boldly live out God’s plan for her life.

#saintsin7days #s7d #saintgianna

“What is a vocation? It is a gift from God, so it comes from God. If it is a gift from God, our concern must be to know God's will. We must enter that path: if God wants, when God wants, how God wants. Never force the door." - St. Gianna Molla #Saintsin7Days 💭 How does God lead you in your vocation? 💭 How do you seek out the path of what He desires for your life? 

#hallowapp #saintgianna #prayforus

“God is there in these moments of rest and can give us in a single instant exactly what we need. Then the rest of the day can take its course under the same effort and strain, perhaps, but in peace. And when night looks back and you see how fragmentary everything has been, and how much you planned that has gone undone, and all the reasons you have to be embarrassed and ashamed: just take everything exactly as it is, put it in God’s hands and leave it to Him – really rest – and start the next day.” - Edith Stein (St. Teresa Benedicta of the Cross) #FeastDay 

— St. Edith Stein was born to a faithful Jewish family in 1891. But as a teenager, Edith concluded that God didn’t exist, so she abandoned her religion. 

🦋 Edith was a brilliant writer and a field nurse in World War I. She received her doctorate and wanted to become a philosophy professor, but was denied due to her sex and Jewish heritage. When she discovered the autobiography of St. Teresa of Ávila, she found the truth she was looking for in Christ. After her baptism, she was even further inspired to enter religious life, taking vows as a Carmelite nun (the same as St. Teresa of Ávila). 

✝️ She would soon embrace her cross as a sacrificial offering for the glory of God and on behalf of the suffering of others. In August 1942, she was arrested by the Gestapo for her Jewish heritage and taken to the Auschwitz concentration camp. They killed her in the gas chambers, but she still witnessed to God’s presence even there. 

#hallowapp

“Dear young people, I would like to look each of you in the eye and say: Do not be afraid! Now I will tell you something even more beautiful: Jesus himself is now looking at you. He knows you; he knows what is in your heart; he smiles at you and tells you once again that he loves you, always and infinitely. Always and infinitely. Go forth then, bringing God’s radiant smile to everyone! Go and bear witness to the joy of faith, to the hope that warms your hearts, and to the love that you bring to everything you do.”

Announcing our next and final Saints in 7 Days of this series: Saints Augustine and Monica.

“If I am Thy child, O God, it is because Thou gavest me such a mother.” - St. Augustine about his mother, St. Monica

Before St. Augustine was a priest, bishop, and author of the most widely read spiritual works in history Confessions, he was a young man finding his way in the world, relying on things that brought him temporary happiness like wealth and pleasure. Augustine’s mother, Monica, constantly prayed for him to discover God’s peace during this season of his life which ultimately lead to himself into the faith and religious life allowing him to guide so many others including us today.

This Saints in 7 Days series will take us through their journey of prayer and how both mother and son would eventually become two of the most well-known saints of all time.

#hallow #prayer #saintaugustine #saintmonica #s7d #saintsin7days

How are you becoming a vessel of God’s love? ❤️

#hallowapp #stclareofassisi

✝️ “Let us not forget that Jesus not only suffered, but also rose in glory; so, too, we go to the glory of the Resurrection by way of suffering and the Cross.”
- St. Maximilian Kolbe #FeastDay

—
Born in Poland in 1894, St. Maximilian Kolbe became a Franciscan priest and missionary. During the German occupation of Poland, he remained at a monastery that published anti-Nazi publications and hid thousands of Jews and refugees.

This underground work led to Fr. Kolbe’s arrest. He was sent to Auschwitz, where even in the horrifying circumstances, he offered solace to fellow inmates and continued his priestly ministry. One day, a prisoner escaped from the camp, so Nazi guards selected ten people for punishment. One of the men cried out for his wife and children. Moved with divine charity, Fr. Kolbe stepped forward and volunteered to take his place in the starvation chambers. This man would survive and attend Maximilian Kolbe’s canonization in 1982.

🙏 Throughout his life, Maximillian Kolbe held a deep devotion to the Blessed Mother. He helped found a movement called the Militia Immaculatae, which promotes total consecration to Mary for the renewal of society.

#hallowapp #stmaximiliankolbe #catholicsaint

It’s Day 1 with St. Augustine and St. Monica in our final week in the #Saintsin7Days series!🙏❤️

✝️ We begin today by first looking at the life of St. Monica before she was the devoted mother of a wayward son, Augustine. Amidst a difficult marriage and lonely life, Monica clung to her faith and found solace in her children, Augustine, Navigus, and Perpetua.

🕊️ She prayed constantly for the conversion of her husband, mother-in-law, and children, and their later conversions were a testament to her inspiring witness of faith.

Pray Day 1 with us today & share with us know what you learn! ⬇️

Guard me, then, O Holy Spirit, That I always may be holy.

Amen.”🕊️

Born in 1586 in Peru, St. Rose lived a life of prayer, asceticism, and charity. She welcomed orphans and the sick in her family's backyard, caring for them with the money she earned doing needlework and selling flowers. She had a special charism of sleeping only two hours a night, but in her weakness and poverty of spirit, she was imbued with the life of the Spirit. She passed away at 32 and was mourned by thousands. 🙏

💭 Did you know that St. Rose of Lima is the patron saint of embroiderers, gardeners, and florists?

Today is the Feast of St. Augustine, Bishop and Doctor of the Church. 🕊️🙏

💭 Reflect today with 3 passages from his autobiography and one of the greatest spiritual works of all time, Confessions: 

💛 “Thou hast made us for thyself, O Lord, and our heart is restless until it finds its rest in thee.” 

✨ “And men go abroad to admire the heights of mountains, the mighty waves of the sea, the broad tides of rivers, the compass of the ocean, and the circuits of the stars, yet pass over the mystery of themselves without a thought.”

🤲 “What does love look like? It has the hands to help others. It has the feet to hasten to the poor and needy. It has eyes to see misery and want. It has the ears to hear the sighs and sorrows of men. That is what love looks like.”

🍎🍐🫐 "Love is a fruit in season at all times and within reach of every hand.”  - Mother Teresa #FeastDay❤️

Today we celebrate the Feast of St. Teresa of Calcutta, best known as ‘Mother Teresa.’ 

Born in Macedonia in 1910 to Albanian parents, Mother Teresa became a missionary with the Sisters of Loreto in Ireland, where she learned English and received her new name inspired by St. Thérèse of Lisieux.

She taught in Calcutta, India for 17 years and became increasingly unsettled by the extreme poverty around her. While riding on a train to a retreat, she received a mystical call to serve “the poorest of the poor.” Jesus spoke to her in visions and asked her to found the Missionaries of Charity. 🙏💙

Then for roughly 50 years, Mother Teresa suffered from intense spiritual darkness, yet her charity and submission to the will of God endured all the while. She centered her day around the Eucharist and set out into the streets, caring for all who were dying from hunger, disease, and neglect.

She died in 1997, fulfilling her mission of “proclaiming God’s thirsting love for humanity.”

🙏 If you’re interested in learning more about Mother Teresa or praying alongside her, check out the Saints in 7 Days: Mother Teresa collection on the app today.

Save this prayer of gratitude to draw near to God at any time of the day. 💜🙏

“Dear Lord, thank you for being with me always. Help me quiet my mind and heart so that I can hear your voice and follow your will. Extend your grace into the business of my life, so that I may learn to be still and notice your presence. I pray for the courage to come to you, to share my burdens, and to listen to your voice. Help me trust in you so that you can hallow my life. Amen.” 

#hallowapp #prayer #gratitude #prayerchangesthings

Sometimes, God speaks to us so quietly that we have to be very still and silent in order to hear Him. 😌❤️ #TheGoodShepherd

#hallowapp #humility #humble #stayhumble #imitationofchrist

Today we remember the Holy Cross. ✝️

While the Church commemorates the saving passion and death of Jesus Christ on Good Friday, the Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross honors the Cross itself. This celebration originated in the 4th century when St. Helena discovered the true cross in Jerusalem and built the Church of the Holy Sepulchre over the site. 

Consider the famous motto of the Carthusians today: “The cross stands while the world turns.” And, swipe through the post to reflect on a beautiful meditation from St. Francis de Sales on the Holy Cross. 🙏 

❤️ “The everlasting God has, in His wisdom, foreseen from eternity the cross He now presents to you as a gift from His inmost heart …” 

#hallowapp #holycross

💙 "She who is the Mother of Sorrows and also the Mother of Consolation can understand you completely and help you.”  - St. Pope John Paul II

Today, we celebrate the Feast of Mary, Our Lady of Sorrows. 

There are seven sorrows of Mary that the Church traditionally honors, including the Prophecy of Simeon, the Flight into Egypt, and the Loss of the Child Jesus in the Temple for Three Days.

Of Mary’s sorrows, her most painful was the Crucifixion — standing by the cross of her Son and watching Him suffer and die. ✝️💔
 
As the Mother of Sorrows, Mary intimately understands our deepest heartache and pain. Yet in the midst of our anguish, she also becomes for us the Mother of Consolation, always ready to comfort us and to bring us closer to Christ.❤️‍🩹

🙏 In honor of this feast, pray the 7 Sorrows Rosary alongside Mary as she leads us through the sorrows of Christ’s life.

📖 Hildegard also wrote many works and letters on theology, natural medicine, and Church reform. In 2012, St. Hildegard of Bingen was named a Doctor of the Church.

"Put your trust in Him and following His example, always act humbly, graciously, and in good faith.” - St. Vincent de Paul #feastday

❤️‍🩹 St. Vincent De Paul was born around 1580 in Pouy, France, to a peasant family. He was impatient and easily angered, but his heart softened over time through dedicated prayer and God’s grace. Vincent grew up working on his family’s farm until he entered seminary.
 
🤲 One of his first priestly assignments was serving as a chaplain to the enslaved peoples in the Parisian galleys. This experience inspired him to form the Congregation of the Mission, or the Vincentians, to be a group of priests dedicated to serving the poor.
 
🏥 Vincent became a spiritual father to St. Louise de Marillac and helped her found the Daughters of Charity, a group of women who established hospitals and also served the poor.
 
🕊️ After his death in 1660, his virtue of charity became an inspiration for many Catholic charitable organizations. There might even be one in your community that you could support with your time or other gifts. 🙏❤️

🕊️New Saints in 7 Days: St. Francis of Assisi

Join Fr. Dave Pivonka, T.O.R., President of Franciscan University in Steubenville, in meditating on the life of St. Francis of Assisi starting today and concluding on St. Francis’s feast day next Wednesday! @franciscanpresident 

🙏 St. Francis is one of the most inspirational saints in the history of the Church and the founder of the Franciscan orders. We’ll pray together for the next 7 days, concluding on his feast day next Wednesday. 

🕊️ St. Francis of Assisi is one of the most famous saints in the history of the Church, known worldwide for his love of animals and the environment and his vows of poverty. While these were crucial parts of his faith, St. Francis has more to teach us. 

🙏 Over the next 7 days, we’ll dive deep into a mini-biography of the life of St. Francis, focusing on a different chapter of his life each day. 

🕊️ We’ll learn about St. Francis’ role as a poet and dreamer and how his faith grew through temptation and brokenness to live a simple yet bold and beautiful life.

More details to come.

Today we celebrate the feast of the Archangels: St. Michael, St. Gabriel, and St. Raphael. 💙

🙏 In Hebrew, the name ‘Michael’ means “Who is like God?” – “a rhetorical question implying no one is like God.” In the Book of the Prophet Daniel, Michael is introduced as the “great prince” who guards God’s people, and in the Book of Revelation, Michael leads the battle against Satan.
 
🙏 ‘Gabriel’ means “strength of God.” In the Gospel of Luke, Gabriel announces to Zechariah the birth of John the Baptist and announces to Mary the Incarnation of Christ. It’s traditionally believed that Gabriel was the messenger to Joseph as well.
 
🙏 Raphael, whose name means “healer of God,” protects Tobiah and Sarah from demonic attack in the Book of Tobit. He also heals Tobiah of his blindness.
 
In honor of this liturgical celebration, join us in praying the St. Michael Chaplet tonight. You can also find the Chaplet in the Daily Prayers section of the app. 

#hallowapp #stmichaelchaplet #stmichael #archangels

🙏💜 Pray with us for a minute now, or save this post for a moment of peace later. 

This beautiful poem-prayer was written by British poet Minnie Louise Haskins and reflects on the spirituality of St. Thérèse of Lisieux. 

#hallowapp #peacewithin #peacewithinprayer #peaceprayer

“Our Lord does not look so much at the greatness of our actions, or even at their difficulty, as at the love with which we do them.” - St. Thérèse of Lisieux (The Little Flower) 🌸🙏💙

St. Therese of Lisieux was born in 1873, the youngest of nine children born to Louis and Zélie Martin, who are also canonized saints. 😇

Therese recalls herself as a difficult child with great anxiety. She felt called at age 14 to dedicate her life to prayer, and after pleading with the bishop, she finally entered the Carmelite convent, taking the name ‘Sister Therese of the Child Jesus and the Holy Face’.

St. Thérèse lived a simple hidden life, marked by a spirituality of childlike trust and doing the ordinary with extraordinary love, often referred to as "the Little Way." Recognizing the beauty and depth of her spirituality, the Church declared her a Doctor of the Church.

Therese suffered from tuberculosis and died at the age of 24. Her last words were, "My God, I love you!" She was canonized in 1925 by Pope Pius XI.

We’d love to invite you to join us in prayer on her feast day on Hallow:

“For he commands his angels with regard to you, to guard you wherever you go.” (Psalm 91:11)

Today we celebrate the Memorial of the Guardian Angels. 

😇 Did you know that God in His goodness has assigned a guardian angel to every human soul from the beginning of our earthly lives until the hour of our death? 

🙏 Guardian angels show us how near God is to His people and how active He is in human history.
 
❤️ While accompanying us on earth, angels constantly look upon the face of God. In doing so, they worship Him and intercede for us in times of temptation and trial, helping us on our pilgrim journey to Heaven.

#hallowapp #guardianangel #guardianangels

“Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you.” ❤️🙏

"Lord, make me an instrument of your peace.” - St. Francis of Assisi #FeastDay 

😇 Today we celebrate St. Francis of Assisi (1182-1226). 

🕊️ Known for his love of ecology, St. Francis is the patron saint of the environment and animals. He is also the founder of the Franciscans, a religious order today that is committed to living out and sharing the Gospel in the spirit of St. Francis. 

🙏 Born around 1182, St. Francis of Assisi grew up with the liberty to do as he pleased. He enjoyed fine clothing, elaborate banquets, and singing in the streets. His life changed when, according to tradition, he encountered a leper while returning home from a military battle. In spite of fear, Francis was moved to kiss and help the leper, realizing later that the leper was Christ.

✝️ After this, Francis famously renounced the luxury of his youth and adopted a life of radical poverty and penance.

❤️ A few years before his death, Francis became the first person to receive the stigmata and bear the wounds of Jesus in his body.

🙏 Pray with today’s Daily Saint meditation or jump right into Saints in 7 Days led by Fr. Dave Pivonka, TOR, @fransicanpresident.

🙏 “My Jesus, support me when difficult and stormy days come, days of testing, days of ordeal, when suffering and fatigue begin to oppress my body and my soul …” - St. Faustina #FeastDay

💙 St. Faustina was born in Poland in 1905. She came from a poor family and had little education. At the age of 7, she felt drawn to religious life, but her parents did not give her permission to enter a convent. 
 
🙏 After many years, she heard God call her to Himself in a vision of the suffering Christ, and she immediately left home for the city of Warsaw. There, she joined the Congregation of the Sisters of Our Lady of Mercy in 1926.
 
💙 As a religious sister, St. Faustina was assigned the simplest tasks. But, she received extraordinary visions of Jesus. During one such vision, Jesus instructed her to have painted what she saw; this painting is known as the image of Divine Mercy.
 
✨Jesus asked her to keep a record of all of these mystical revelations, and her writings inspired the Apostolic Movement of the Divine Mercy, which proclaims God’s merciful love throughout the world.

🙏 Join us in reflecting today with this beautiful prayer from St. Faustina’s diary or join us in praying the Divine Mercy Chaplet.

Today kicks off Week 2 of Secrets of the Rosary: Luminous Mysteries with guide Sr. Mary Grace, an incredible Sister of Life originally from Australia! ❤️

🙏 The Luminous Mysteries lead us through the key events of Jesus’s public ministry, between His baptism and His passion. They help us understand Jesus as the Light of the World. 

💛 St. Pope John Paul II also called them the Mysteries of Light as they lead us closer to Jesus, the Light of the World. 

✨ “Certainly the whole mystery of Christ is a mystery of light. He is the “light of the world” (Jn 8:12). Yet this truth emerges in a special way during the years of his public life, when he proclaims the Gospel of the Kingdom.” - St. Pope John Paul II

#hallowapp #luminousmysteries

"The only thing we have to ask God for, in prayer, is the desire to be holy.” - Bl. Carlo Acutis

🙏 Blessed Carlo Acutis was born in London, England in 1991. Not long after his birth, his family moved back to Italy.

💻 Carlo was a typical teenager. He loved sports, video games, and computers. With his technological skills, he built an online database for Eucharistic miracles to enliven devotion to the Blessed Sacrament. 
 
❤️ From a young age, he embraced his Catholic faith, even though his parents were not particularly devout. After receiving his First Holy Communion, he went to Mass every single day, and his deep spirituality led to a renewal of faith in his mother. At age 15, Carlo was diagnosed with leukemia, and he offered all of his sufferings to the Pope and the Church.
 
🕊️ He died on October 12, 2006, and was buried in Assisi, per his wishes, because of his devotion to St. Francis. We celebrate his feast day today!

🙏  Pray with Bl. Carlo Acutis in today’s Daily Saint meditation.

It’s the anniversary of the Miracle of the Sun at Fatima! 💛 We put together a few of our favorite pictures from our day at Fatima with @jonathanroumieofficial and @mattmahermusic. ☀️

On this day in 1917, “the sun danced” just as Our Lady of Fatima had promised the children at Fatima.

🙏 While more than 50,000 people gathered near la Cova da Iria in the rain to see the shining Blessed Mother, Lucia, Francisco, and Jacinta saw a different apparition of the Holy Family — St. Joseph with Jesus and Mary as both Our Lady of Sorrows and Our Lady of Mt. Carmel.

🕊️ “A great sign appeared in the sky, a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.” (Revelation 12:1)

Happy feast day, St. Teresa of Ávila! Did you know Teresa is Hallow’s patron saint? 

Reflect with this prayer today or join us in starting the St. Teresa Novena on the app. 

💛 St. Teresa was born into a large family and lived in Ávila, Spain in the 1500s. As a young girl, reading stories about martyrs inflamed in her a desire for martyrdom, to the point where she once ran away from home to seek it.

🌎 From a young age, Teresa meditated heavily on the passing nature of the world as well as the unchanging nature of God.

✝️ Still, Teresa became distracted by worldly things and grew attached to earthly pleasures. But with the help of spiritual books, she returned again and again to the practice of prayer. At age 20, Teresa entered the Carmelites and worked with St. John of the Cross to reform their order.

🙏 Teresa was a mystic and engaged in deep contemplative prayer. Her writings, most notably The Interior Castle, led her to be named a Doctor of the Church for the significant impact she made on the Church's spiritual theology.

🙏 Week 3: Secrets of the Rosary with @jonathanroumieofficial   ❤️ This week we’re journeying through the Sorrowful Mysteries — the events of Jesus’s Agony, Passion, and Death. 
 One of the most powerful ways Jonathan prepares for his portrayal of Jesus in The Chosen is praying the Rosary, and we’re excited for you to experience this week with him meditating on the Sorrowful Mysteries. We know the third week of any challenge can be difficult, but we encourage you to stick with us this week or to jump right in if you’ve missed some of the Secrets of the Rosary.   This is a beautiful opportunity for you to rely not on your strength but on Jesus’s in His loving sacrifice for us. ✝️  #sorrowfulmysteries #monthoftherosary #rosary

My heart has been heavy this last week with all that is happening in the world, especially having a personal connection to the situation. I had planned to share with you more about my love for the Rosary and its significance in my life as we begin the @hallowapp Mysteries of the Rosary Challenge today, but instead I just want to invite you to pray with me the Sorrowful Mysteries. When speaking about the Rosary, Saint Padre Pio said: “Hand me my weapon.” He referred to the Rosary as “the greatest weapon we have against the devil.” One of the most powerful weapons we have is prayer, so I ask you to join me in prayer today. 
The Sorrowful Mysteries of the Rosary focus on the events of Jesus’ Agony, Passion, and Death. Starting today, I will be meditating on these events, praying for peace and the defeat of evil. 
I’ll be using my new Hallow X Ghirelli Rosary in collaboration with @hallowapp and @ghirellirosaries_usa. 
Join me in the Mysteries of the Rosary Challenge with the Sorrowful Mysteries on Hallow hallow.com/jonathan. 
God bless you and pray for all those suffering innocents in the Middle East right now…
🙏🏽❤️‍🩹💜

"For where your treasure is, there also will your heart be." (Luke 12:34) 

🙏 Today, we celebrate the feast of St. Luke. 

The Evangelist is believed to have been a disciple and traveling companion of the Apostle St. Paul, who refers to St. Luke in his Letter to the Colossians as “the beloved physician” (Col. 4:14).

📖 Luke became the author of the Gospel of Luke and the Acts of the Apostles, gathering eyewitness accounts to write these texts. He contributed to the New Testament with rich vocabulary, intimate accounts of Mary’s life, and descriptions of the early Church. 🕊️

🩺 🎨 St. Luke is the patron saint of doctors and artists. He is often represented by a winged ox in art.

#stluke #gospelofluke

The St. Jude Novena is one of the most widely-prayed novenas year after year, and we’re so excited to start the novena today with guide Giavani Cairo @gcairo06, who portrays Jude Thaddeus in The Chosen!!

💭 You’ll hear special reflections from Giavani on his role as Jude Thaddeus and can reflect for longer with Scriptural imaginative prayer. 

💛 Through the Gospel, we’ll imagine ourselves praying right before the face of Jesus, just as the legend holds that St. Jude brought the dying king a cloth impressed with Jesus’s face, and the king was miraculously healed. 

🙏 St. Jude is the patron saint of difficult circumstances, impossible situations, and hopeless causes. I hope you’ll bring anything weighing on your heart to prayer over these next 9 days. 

✝️ Together with Giavani and St. Jude, we’ll give the difficult, impossible, and hopeless all to Jesus leading up to the feast of St. Jude.

“The most beautiful and stirring adventure that can happen to you is the personal meeting with Jesus, who is the only one who gives real meaning to our lives.” - St. Pope John Paul II #FeastDay

💛 John Paul II, born Karol Wojtyla, is one of the most beloved saints of modern times. We celebrate his feast day. 

😇 Did you know that in his time as pope, John Paul II canonized 482 saints? 

🗺️ He was also known for his travel around the world, the promulgation of the Catechism, and the start of World Youth Day, among many other efforts in his life. In his final years, he suffered from Parkinson’s and died in 2005 on the eve of Divine Mercy Sunday. 🕊️

🙏 We invite you to pray with the voice of John Paul II in his address to young people in 1987 or his “Letter to Women” read by @jenniferfulwiler in honor of his feast today on the app.

During the Rwandan genocide, Immaculée Ilibagiza hid with seven other women in a 3 x 4 bathroom for 91 days and prayed the Rosary 27 times daily. When people ask her how she survived, she often says, “It was because of the rosary. The rosary is the prayer that saved my life.” ❤️🙏

❤️ We’re blessed to have Immaculée Ilibagiza lead us through our fourth and final week of the Secrets of the Rosary, praying the Glorious Mysteries. 

🙏 She shares some truly inspiring reflections on how the Rosary helped her talk to God and stay hopeful in hiding even when the devil tempted her to give up hope.

❤️ Join us in growing closer to Jesus alongside Mary as we near the end of the Secrets of the Rosary challenge and this Month of the Rosary.

Did you know that over the last 50 years, an estimated 8 million Americans have had near-death experiences, meaning they’ve undergone clinical death and come back to life?

Starting on Halloween, we’ll dive deep into the stories, science, and spiritual witnesses behind near-death experiences alongside priest, philosopher, and scientist Fr. Robert Spitzer, S.J.  Fr. Spitzer holds a Ph.D. in philosophy from the Catholic University of America. He has spent decades researching near-death experiences becoming one of the world's leading experts in the field. Also, the former president of Gonzaga University, Fr. Spitzer has been featured on many TV shows, including a feature on Larry King Live with the late Stephen Hawking. 

🙏 With Fr. Spitzer and Hallow Guide Anna, you’ll learn the science and methodology behind near-death experiences and see how science and faith meet in the extraordinary, fascinating, and true stories of many individuals.

Answer the Pope’s call to pray today. 

”Lord God of Peace, hear our prayer.”
”Lord God of Peace, hear our prayer.”
”Lord God of Peace, hear our prayer.”

Pope Francis @franciscus calls us to prayer, fasting, and penance for peace today. 

Join us in prayer for an hour today at 11 a.m. CST (6:00 p.m. at the Vatican). 

Pray the Holy Rosary, spend an hour in Eucharistic Adoration, or find more prayers in the Prayers for Peace collection on the app, including Pope Francis’s prayer for peace to deliver us from the violence of war and to renew us as peacemakers.

📣 We’ve had such a hard time keeping quiet about this announcement … 
 This Advent, we’ll journey through the powerful writings of C.S. Lewis, author of the Chronicles of Narnia and one of the greatest Christian apologists of all time, with daily readings, reflections, and meditations leading up to Christmas.🎄❤️

📖 With excerpts from Mere Christianity, The Four Loves, and more, you’ll see where you can grow in your surrender to Christ and open your heart to Him through wonder and repentance. I couldn’t think of a better author to guide us toward God’s greatest gift to us: Jesus.

"Look for yourself, and you will find in the long run only hatred, loneliness, despair, rage, ruin, and decay. But look for Christ and you will find Him, and with Him everything else thrown in.” - C.S. Lewis, Mere Christianity

Part 4 of the Catechism in a Year with @fathermikeschmitz starts today! 🙏 Jump into Christian Prayer and learn or rediscover How to Pray. @catholicfaithformation

“The wonder of prayer is revealed beside the well where we come seeking water: there, Christ comes to meet every human being. It is he who first seeks us and asks us for a drink. Jesus thirsts; his asking arises from the depths of God's desire for us. Whether we realize it or not, prayer is the encounter of God's thirst with ours. God thirsts that we may thirst for him.” (CCC 2560)

🎄🎁 The Ultimate Catholic Gift Guide for Advent and Christmas 2023! 

The gift-giving tradition goes back to the Nativity, a few days after Christ was born. The three wise men followed the bright Star of Bethlehem to meet baby Jesus in Bethlehem. Known as King Balthasar (from Arabia), King Melchior (from Persia), and King Gaspar (from India), they brought Jesus gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh and recognized Him as the Son of God.

"When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit upon his glorious throne, and all the nations will be assembled before him.” (Matthew 25:31-32) 

🌎 Today we celebrate the Solemnity of Our Lord Jesus Christ, King of the Universe.

🙏”The Solemnity of Christ, King of the Universe, invites us to repeat with faith the prayer of the Our Father, which Jesus himself taught us: ‘Thy kingdom come’. Thy kingdom come, O Lord!‘“ - St. Pope John Paul II, 1997

🎄❤️ The first Sunday of Advent is just one week from today! During Advent, we prepare for Jesus, who brought Light into the darkness, for four weeks, represented by the four candles around the Advent wreath.

✨ The circular shape of the Advent wreath symbolizes God’s infinite love for us – it is never-ending, just like the true Light of the World, Jesus, who leads us into eternal life with Him.

🕯️ First Candle - Hope (Prophecy Candle)
🕯️ Second Candle - Peace (Bethlehem Candle)
🕯️ Third Candle - Joy (Shepherd’s Candle)
🕯️ Fourth Candle - Love (Angel’s Candle)

🎄❤️ Today is the Feast of St. Andrew the Apostle! St. Andrew was Jesus’s first apostle and the brother of St. Peter, the second apostle. His feast marks the start of the St. Andrew Christmas Novena. 

🙏 Traditionally, this novena is prayed fifteen times daily and concludes on Christmas Eve.

🗓️ Did you know that St. Andrew’s feast day helps us determine the start of Advent in the liturgical calendar? 
The first Sunday of Advent is always the closest Sunday to his feast, whether before or after. We can also look to Andrew’s role in the Gospels — they align well with the purpose of this novena: to prepare for the coming of Jesus. 

✨ Read more about this novena and St. Andrew by visiting our blog (link in our bio).

“No soul that seriously and constantly desires joy will ever miss it. Those who seek find. Those who knock it is opened.” - C.S. Lewis

“Your place in heaven will seem to be made for you and you alone, because you were made for it — made for it stitch by stitch as a glove is made for a hand.” - C.S. Lewis

Amid the worries and responsibilities of life, it’s easy to lose sight of the mystery of Christ’s birth. So, how do we regain it? How do we open up our hearts this Advent to Jesus’ love in a new way?

🙏 ❤️ Don’t miss Day 1 of Advent with C.S. Lewis, starting tomorrow!

Advent with C.S. Lewis starts today! Listen in for a preview. 🙏

We’re so excited for all of the kids, families, and classrooms beginning this journey to Bethlehem alongside the Holy Family in the weeks leading up to Christmas. 

🕯️ ✝️ In today’s meditation, we explore how the Advent season leads us to share Jesus’s light and love and why it’s represented by a wreath and four candles. 

🙏 ”Dear Jesus, we are so excited to welcome you on Christmas day. Teach us to honor you in all we do, think, and say. This Advent, may we share the joy of your birth, and with your help, spread the good news to all the earth. Lord Jesus, make our hearts your home. Amen.”

Listen in for a sneak peek with your prayer guide @jonathanroumieofficial … 

🙏❤️ How is God calling you to rediscover His Son this Advent? How is He calling you to open up your heart?

Day 3: Imaginative Prayer ✨

Today, we turn to Aslan the Lion from C.S. Lewis's "Chronicles of Narnia" series.

🙏 God, thank you for making yourself small for us, for making yourself approachable, for marrying your divinity with our humanity so that we can more fully come to know you. Thank you for always making the first move, extending the invitation because you are the One who wants to be so close to us. 🙏

“The giver of every good and perfect gift has called upon us to mimic His giving, by grace, through faith, and this is not of ourselves.” - St. Nicholas

Yesterday was Saint Nicholas Day!🎄❤️✨

What a challenge Lewis presents for us: to see each person we encounter as an eternal being, made in God’s image and likeness. 🙏💜 #Advent #Pray25

Today, we celebrate the Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception of Mary. 🙏💙

As Pope Pius IX said in 1854, and as quoted in the Catechism, 

“The most Blessed Virgin Mary was, from the first moment of her conception, by a singular grace and privilege of almighty God and by virtue of the merits of Jesus Christ, Savior of the human race, preserved immune from all stain of original sin.”

🙏 Reflect with a homily from @fathermikeschmitz, pray a Rosary or listen to Marian music to celebrate the saving grace of Christ on this holy day.

Read more about the Immaculate Conception via the blog link in our bio.

Reflect today with this beautiful reflection on Christ’s birth in memory of Ven. Fulton Sheen. 🙏❤️ 

“The inn was the gathering place of public opinion, the focal point of the world's moods, the rendezvous of the worldly, the rallying place of the popular and the successful. But there's no room in the place where the world gathers. The stable is a place for outcasts, the ignored and the forgotten. The world might have expected the Son of God to be born in an inn; a stable would certainly be the last place in the world where one would look for him. The lesson is: divinity is always where you least expect to find it. So the Son of God made man is invited to enter into his own world through a back door.” - Ven. Fulton Sheen

“Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight His paths.”

In our readings today, both John the Baptist and Peter speak of repentance, which is an important part of how we prepare for the Second Coming. 

Part of preparing the way for the Lord means converting our hearts and allowing them to return to God, for Whom they were created.

🙏❤️ How is your heart transforming this Advent?

In yesterday’s Gospel reading and powerful reflection by Jeff Cavins, we reflected on John the Baptist’s call for repentance: “Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight his paths.” 

As we await the coming King in the manger this Christmas, we’re asked to take seriously the truth that Jesus will come again at the end of time.

In The World’s Last Night, Lewis invites us to imagine the history of the world as one long play with an ending that is a mystery to us.

"The doctrine of the Second Coming teaches us that we do not and cannot know when the world drama will end. We do not know the play." - C.S. Lewis, The World's Last Night

#advent #cslewis #secondcoming

Hoy es la Fiesta de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe. 

🙏💙 Today is the Feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe. 

Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe es una de las advocaciones más conocidas de María. El 9 de diciembre de 1531, María se apareció a San Juan Diego en el cerro del Tepeyac (actual Ciudad de México). Tres días después, el 12 de diciembre, Juan Diego recibió una señal milagrosa de la Virgen María. Ese mismo día, siglos después, celebramos la fiesta de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe.

🙏💙 Our Lady of Guadalupe is one of Mary’s most well-known titles. On December 9, 1531, Mary appeared to St. Juan Diego on Tepeyac Hill (now México City). Three days later, on December 12, Juan Diego received a miraculous sign from the Virgin Mary. On this same day, centuries later, we celebrate the Feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe.

“Hijo mío el más querido: No es nada lo que te espantó, te afligió, que no se altere tu rostro, tu corazón. Por favor no temas esta enfermedad, ni en ningún modo a enfermedad otra alguna o dolor entristecedor. ¿Acaso no estoy yo aquí, yo que tengo el honor de ser tu madre? ¿Acaso no estás bajo mi sombra, bajo mi amparo? ¿Acaso no soy yo la fuente de tu alegría? ¿Qué no estás en mi regazo, en el cruce de mis brazos? ¿Por ventura aun tienes necesidad de cosa otra alguna?” -  Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe a San Juan Diego

🙏💙 “Listen, put it into your heart, most little of my sons:  Let nothing frighten or grieve you,  Let not your heart be disturbed,  Do not fear any sickness or anguish. Am I not here, who am your Mother?  Are you not under my protection?  Am I not your health?  Are you not happily within the folds of my mantle, held safely in my arms?  Do you need anything more?  Let nothing else worry you or disturb you.” - Our Lady of Guadalupe to St. Juan Diego

Here’s a sneak peak of ‘Go Tell It On The Mountain’.

✨ 12 Days of Christmas Music with guide @ben_rector starts today!✨  🎄❤️✨Join us for 12 incredible days of joyful prayer and music leading up to Christmas, starting today with the beloved Christmas carol: “O Come, All Ye Faithful” recorded by Ben exclusively on Hallow!

Whether you’ve listened to these songs a million times or they’re brand new to you, we promise this series will open your eyes to the wonder and joy of Christmas. 🙏 One of the greatest things about praying with music is that it gives us something to offer God, whether in your heart or through your singing.

“But supposing God became a man…” - C.S. Lewis, Mere Christianity

The Second Coming that we are reminded of throughout Advent is also a reminder of our need for repentance. How do we repent? How do we turn back to God? 🙏

✨ Wonderstruck: to be confronted with your own smallness in the face of life’s great mysteries, requiring humility and an openness to the reality that there is knowledge beyond our reach✨

🎄 How have you rediscovered the wonder of Christ this Advent? 

🙏 We’ve meditated on His coming into our hearts, His Second Coming at the end of time, and in just a couple of days, we’ll begin meditating on His coming as an infant in Bethlehem. 

💜 Has your heart been wonderstruck this Advent?

Today’s Responsorial Psalm comes from Mary’s beautiful Magnificat (Luke 1:46-55). As we reflect in today's Pray25 meditation with Jeff Cavins we reflect on Mary’s example to us. She offers us another way. 🙏💙

In the entire Annunciation account, Our Lady sits, she listens, and most importantly she receives. 

After receiving what God has offered her, we see that she is able to respond, to proclaim his goodness and his mercy. She says yes (fiat). 

Her heart rejoices in the Lord, just like Isaiah’s. The reason? She’s not so busy grasping for control that she fails to receive what God had planned for her all along.

How can you imitate Mary?
How can you say “yes”?
How can you receive Him into your life? 

🤲

#fiat #magnificat #advent

Enter into imaginative prayer with us on the Nativity today in Advent Pray25:

"Let’s start by setting the scene. You’ve likely heard the story before: young Mary, heavily pregnant, finds herself in Bethlehem alongside her husband Joseph. The inns are full, there is nowhere for them to stay, and, even more pressing: it’s time for the child to be born. You can picture the pair of them winding through the streets of Bethlehem; it’s just a small little village, the evening air is rather chilly this time of year. Perhaps you notice that Joseph looks a bit worried, his brow all furrowed. And maybe you look at Mary, where she’s perched on the donkey–what does her face look like? Is she the picture of calm? Perhaps there’s a concentration in her eyes, in her posture, that tells you that her whole being is turned towards her unborn child, focused on bringing him into the world safely."

Jump into Day 17 of the Advent challenge to continue praying with us. 🙏

🏠 This is the the great mystery we’ve been waiting for this season — that 2,000 years ago, Christ came to live with us. To dwell with us. 

As you listen to this passage from Mere Christianity today, ask yourself what repairs or renovations are needed before He comes at Christmas to your home? 🙏❤️

Join us in starting the Holy Family Novena tonight. We’ll pray every day leading up to the Feast of the Holy Family. ❤️🙏

After our journey this Advent, how will you say “yes” to God this Christmas? 

Tonight on Christmas Eve, we remember the Holy Family’s journey to Bethlehem and Mary’s beautiful model of fiat — saying yes to God and trusting in His plan. 🙏❤️

Fiat — “let it be done.”

❤️🎄Joy to the World! Jesus has come! From all of us at Hallow, we wish you a Merry Christmas!

Playing: “Joy to the World” by @ben_rector

Today is the feast of St. John. 🦅

Often represented as an eagle in sacred art, St. John was one of the 12 Apostles, and he is traditionally believed to be the sacred author of the Gospel of John, the three Letters of John, and the Book of Revelation.

Throughout the Gospels, we hear how John shared in deep intimacy with Christ. John is referred to as the “beloved disciple,” knowing his identity as securely loved in relation to Christ. He is the sole Apostle who does not abandon Jesus at the crucifixion, and he receives Christ’s final gift to the Church, that is, the care of our Mother Mary. After the Resurrection, John is the first Apostle to recognize the Risen Lord. Of all the 12 Apostles, John is the only one who was not martyred. He suffered exile, but he returned to Ephesus, where he died at 94 years of age.

🙏 Join us in praying the Daily Saint or with scripture written by the beloved apostle today in honor of his feast.

📣 Join the waitlist for the new Hallow Course on Routines and discovering Divine Rhythms with @leah.darrow, starting January 1!

As you look toward making resolutions and setting goals for your faith in the new year, this is an incredible course to guide you through routines and habit-building with insights from Leah and lessons from the routines of some of your favorite saints. 🙏

🗓️✅“Routines are more than just a series of tasks or habits. They hold the key to unlocking your potential.” @leah.darrow

✝️ Today, we celebrate the feast of the Holy Family of Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

We look to the Holy Family as an icon of the Blessed Trinity and as a model for how we are to live within our own families - freely giving of ourselves and receiving the other as gifts from God. ❤️🙏 As Mother Teresa famously said, “If you want to change the world, go home and love your family.”

#holyfamily #motherteresa

“If Jesus is Life, Mary is the Mother of Life. If Jesus is Hope, Mary is the Mother of Hope. If Jesus is Peace, Mary is the Mother of Peace, Mother of the Prince of Peace.” - Pope St. John Paul II

Today, we remember and celebrate the Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God. On this first day of 2024 and one week after we celebrate the birth of Christ, we give thanks to His mother. 💙🙏

“Truth, by which the world is held together, has sprung from the earth, in order to be carried in a woman’s arms … Truth, which heaven is not big enough to hold, has sprung from the earth, in order to be placed in a manger.” - St. Augustine

Today is the Epiphany of the Lord — remembering the three magi who traveled from the east, following a star across the desert to meet the newborn baby Jesus. ⭐️👑 We invite you to celebrate and reflect today on the same revelation of the Wise Men — that Jesus is the Son of God.

📖 It happened in those days that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized in the Jordan by John. On coming up out of the water he saw the heavens being torn open and the Spirit, like a dove, descending upon him. And a voice came from the heavens, “You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased.” (Mark 1:9-11) #BaptismofJesus 

🕊️ Jesus didn't need to be baptized as He was the Son of God, yet by doing so, He embraced His humanity. He shows us that He had come to be with us, amidst all of our sins and weakness. 

🙏 How has Jesus shown you healing and mercy?

Lent is less than a month away! As we prepare for this deeply spiritual and vital season for our faith, we’re excited to announce that the Pray40 challenge waitlist is now open! ✝️🙏

Starting on Ash Wednesday, February 14, we’ll pray together as one community in the 40 days leading up to Jesus’s crucifixion on Good Friday and His resurrection on Easter Sunday.

Over 1 million people from all over the world joined us in prayer last Lent, and we can’t wait for you to be a part of the challenge this year. 

📣 Stay tuned for more announcements about the incredible guides and book that will guide us to surrender it all to God this Lent. 

#lent #pray40 #hallowapp

"Faith is taking the first step, even when you don't see the whole staircase.” - Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. #MLKDay

Today in honor of the @MarchforLife, we’re praying the Litany of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of Life. We ask Mary to pray for our world, that we may respect life from conception to natural death. 

Mary, pray for us. 🙏💙

As we head toward another transformative Lenten season, we’re beyond grateful to join communities across the country in prayer. We’d be delighted to have your parish or church join us by sending you a Free Lent Kit. 🙏✝️

Our Lent Kits are a free set of resources that make it easy for you to invite your fellow parishioners, churchgoers, and community members to unite in daily prayer throughout Lent.

We only have a limited amount remaining, and we’re on track to be sold out within the next few days. So we encourage you to request yours as soon as possible!

Order your Free Lent Kit via the link in our bio or stories.

This Lent, we’ll walk through the life-changing, spiritual classic He Leadeth Me, written by Fr. Walter J. Ciszek, S.J. ✝️📖
 
He Leadeth Me chronicles Fr. Walter’s radical testament of faith as a Jesuit priest and missionary in the Soviet Union. He was imprisoned for over twenty years, first in solitary confinement and then in a Siberian worker camp. Amidst some of the most brutal conditions imaginable, Fr. Walter underwent a profound spiritual journey. In fear, he found hope. In confinement, he surrendered his life to God. 
 
“He Leadeth Me is probably the most influential book that I’ve read in the last twenty years, maybe my entire life. So, if you want to read a book that will change your life ... it will change the way you look at God. It will change the way you look at your own life. It will change the way you pray.” - @fathermikeschmitz

Throughout Pray40, we’ll meditate on Fr. Walter’s radical story of surrender, discovering what it means to rely on God through the challenges and circumstances in our lives. 🙏 

📣 Stay tuned for more Lent announcements in the coming weeks!

"Whatever you do, think of the Glory of God as your main goal.” - St. John Bosco #FeastDay

John Bosco grew up in a poor household in Italy. When he wasn’t studying or praying, he was tending the fields and giving the little he had to the poor. 🙏💜
 
His first teacher, a parish priest, inspired him to enter the seminary, and John was ordained in 1841. After witnessing the awful conditions of children confined in city prisons, Don Bosco resolved to devote his life to mentoring the youth. 🙏

💜 🏫 He opened the Oratory of St. Francis de Sales and became famous for his teaching style, which rejected physical punishment and inspired love for the virtues. With tireless joy and charity, he formed the boys through gentle instruction in the faith.
 
Don Bosco died in 1888 and earned the title “Father and Teacher of Youth.”

“Nothing, not even death, can separate us from God. Nothing can touch us that does not come from his hand; nothing can trouble us because all things come from his hand. 

Is this too simple, or are we just afraid really to believe it, to accept it fully and in every detail of our lives, to yield ourselves up to it in total commitment? This is the ultimate question of faith, and each must answer it for himself in the quiet of his heart and the depths of his soul. 

But to answer it in the affirmative is to know a peace, to discover a meaning to life, that surpasses all understanding.”

- Fr. Walter Ciszek, He Leadeth Me

Dive deep into the ultimate question with us this Lent, journeying through the incredibly powerful spiritual classic He Leadeth Me. 

Pray40 starts in 2 days.

Today is Ash Wednesday, the first day of Pray40, and the start of our Lent journey together. ✝️

This Lent, we’ll pray together every day as we seek to imitate Jesus — His total surrender and His humility. To begin, we’ll turn today to one of the most important and transforming prayers that we have: the Litany of Humility. 

@jonathanroumieofficial will guide us through this powerful prayer, and we’ll also hear excerpts on humility from the book He Leadeth Me with @fathermikeschmitz in Pray40 today. 

🙏 ”O Jesus! meek and humble of heart … Hear me.”🙏

A blessed Ash Wednesday and a Holy Lent to all of you. May your journey take you deeper this season to the heart of surrender in the desert of self sacrifice. 

Thanks @foxandfriends, @marthamaccallum and @abcgma3 for hosting @markwahlberg and I and letting us share about our faith which sustains us and from which all blessings flow. 🙏🏽♥️

Thanks @hallowapp for bringing us out and Fr. Mark Mary with @cfr_franciscans  for mass and ashes today to kick it all off!

✝️GLORY BE!! Today, for the first-time ever, we have over 1 million people praying together in the Lent Pray40 challenge! On top of that, glory be to God, we’ve reached #2 on the App Store, being the first religious app to do so.

🙏We’re more hopeful than ever this Ash Wednesday that the faith is still alive and that people, especially those praying this Lent for the first time ever or returning to the faith, are hungering to grow closer to God.

As @markwahlberg said earlier today, “What better than to have Ash Wednesday fall on Valentine’s Day? Because where do you get more love than with the Lord? And in a time where there’s such a disconnect, we need things to bring people together, and the power of prayer is doing that.” 💜

#1 in the App Store!! Glory Be - He is #1

We are overjoyed with how powerful Day 1 of Lent Pray40 was. Not only did over 1 million people join the challenge and start a transformational prayer journey yesterday, Hallow also became the first religious app to ever reach the top of the App Store Charts!

➡️ Swipe right for a comparison of our small team to the teams behind the apps we’re sitting next to in the App Store today! We are so grateful for the dedication of all our team members at Hallow to help people all over the world pray.

Day 2: Lent Pray40 ✝️

Listen to this powerful passage from He Leadeth Me read by @fathermikeschmitz. 

“No man’s life is insignificant in God’s sight, nor are his works insignificant—no matter what the world or his neighbors or family or friends may think of them. Yet what a terrible responsibility is here. For it means that no moment can be wasted, no opportunity missed, since each has a purpose in man’s life, each has a purpose in God’s plan.”

In today’s meditation, we see how God’s plan worked in the life of Walter Ciszek. Just like Fr. Ciszek, God has a plan for our lives, too.

🙏💜 What is He preparing for you? What is He calling you to?    —

Jeremiah 29:11 ✝️ “I know the plans I have for you, says the Lord, plans for your welfare and not for harm, to give you a future with hope.”

God has a plan for you. He wants you to grow. He wants to give you freedom from something so that you can follow Him more closely. 🙏💜

Pray with @markwahlberg every Friday this Lent. 

#stayprayedup

"We adore You O Christ and praise You. Because by Your Holy Cross You have redeemed the world." 

The Stations of the Cross, also known as the Way of the Cross and the Way of Sorrow (Via Crucis in Latin), detail the fourteen different moments on the day Jesus died. Much like a prayer pilgrimage, Stations are a powerful way to grow closer to Jesus, especially on Fridays throughout Lent when they're traditionally prayed. 

🙏✝️ Pray the Stations of the Cross with a variety of guests on the app, including @bishopbarron, Lisa from @walkingwithpurpose_official , and @therealjimcaviezel

“The fruit of prayer is deepening of faith. And the fruit of faith is love.” - Mother Teresa

How can you show love to others this Lent? Share with us! ⬇️💜

Today in the Gospel reading, Jesus enters the desert — the unknown, the unexpected, the wild. 

✝️

Today Pray40, Fr. Mike shares a powerful reflection with us on expectations, looking at the Gospel reading and the life of Fr. Walter Ciszek.

“Though our situation may have been somewhat unique, the temptation itself was not." - Fr. Walter in He Leadeth Me

Reflecting on this passage, Fr. Mike said,

"And this is the key for every one of us. This is why this Lent, this series, this life is all about what happens in so many ways, what happens when reality runs up against our expectations ... So what do we do? This is the question." 

🙏💜 Join us in prayer today with @fathermikeschmitz in Pray40

We hope you felt a transformation in the first week of Pray40 as we meditated together on God’s plan for our lives. ✝️ Today we begin Week 2 of Pray40: He Leadeth Me, continuing our meditation on the life of Fr. Walter Ciszek.  

🙏 We’ll dive further into the story of Fr. Walter and his entry into the Soviet Union, where he was forbidden from sharing his faith. God’s plan was clear until it suddenly wasn’t, leading Fr. Walter to ask: Why me? Why now? We’ll meditate on these questions, turning from God’s plan for our lives to trials and suffering this week.

 P.S. 1 Million+ + are praying together this Lent in Pray40. It’s not too late for you to jump in! 💜

Today in Pray40, we’ll hear how Fr. Ciszek and his friend Fr. Nestrov were charged with espionage and separated from one another. 

✝️ One of the most difficult meditations of Pray40, today’s passage also begins a journey for Fr. Ciszek that will bring about some of the most meaningful moments of the book. 

As we dive further into He Leadeth Me, we encourage you to continue on. Don’t back down. God wants to do something significant for you through the story of Fr. Ciszek’s life.

Join us today in imaginative prayer with Jesus on the Cross with Sr. Miriam as our guide. 🙏✝️

“Imagine what Christ sees as he looks down. His body at this point has been beaten and broken … Where were his apostles, His closest friends in His hour of need?”

Join us in listening to the first Surrender Story this Lent with Fr. Frankie Cicero! 🙏💜 @lifestartshere_fire 
 Fr. Frankie’s surrender story goes all the way back to his mother’s pregnancy. From complications in the womb, the doctors told her that Fr. Frankie had a 2% chance of living. His mother chose life for Frankie, a life dedicated to God, but not a life without physical suffering.
 
At 18, his father left them. Broken and devastated, Fr. Frankie turned to a life of addiction and promiscuity, trying to fill a void in his life. Until one night at the bar, things changed. He cried out to God. 

Listen to the full story in Pray40. 

✝️ “For me, surrender didn’t happen in one moment of my life. It happened many times, over and over.” - Fr. Frankie Cicero in Pray40

“In the world you will have trouble, but take courage, I have conquered the world.” 
 🌎🙏 Meditate on John 16:33 today in Pray40 with @markwahlberg. 
 “Jesus tells us: take courage.”

Today in Pray40 with @fathermikeschmitz on this second Sunday of Lent:

“We have interruptions in our expectations and interruptions in our routines. They reveal our conditions. They reveal basically what we're placing our trust in. Am I placing my trust in my plan? Am I placing my trust in my routine? Am I placing my trust in my expectations? Or am I placing my trust in God?"

🙏💜

It’s Week 3: Pray40! 🙏💜

✝️ We’ll focus our time this week on how surrender comes to a culmination for Fr. Ciszek as he understands his own need for it. Then, through meditating on his journey, we’ll learn what it means to surrender ourselves to God. 

 “Yet, thanks be to God, I did still endure—and I had learned, to the depths of my shaken soul, how totally I depended on him for everything even in my survival and how foolish had been my reliance upon self …” - Fr. Walter Ciszek in He Leadeth Me

Today’s Surender Story with Jim Wahlberg ✝️ @jimbow36 

🙏 “I remember seeing humility for the first time in my life – as the cardinal processed in, with his big hat and his big staff up onto the stage, which served as the altar. He had his own special chair, and next to him, he had a special chair for Mother Teresa. And he beckoned her to come. And she politely refused …” 

Hear Jim’s powerful story of surrendering his life to God today in Pray40.

"Surrender is not the same as giving up. 

Giving up is walking away. 

Surrender is giving control to God.

When we surrender to God, we give him access to our lives. 

We let go and trust in His plan for us. 

This is scary, yes, but it’s worth it. 

We have to die to ourselves, but Jesus is worth dying for. 

There is no greater gift than what Jesus offers us: salvation, eternal life." 

✝️

Pray with @markwahlberg today in Pray40.

“If any of you need to hear this today, know that God loves you. God loves you dearly, and He has a great plan for your life. He is pursuing you, and He is worthy of our trust. Be blessed.”

💜, Your Spiritual Grandmama, Sr. Bernice #Pray40

✝️ This week in Pray40, we’ll have an up-close look at what it was like for Fr. Ciszek when he was transferred from solitary confinement to a worker camp in Siberia. Faced with continuing difficulties and new challenges, Fr. Ciszek turned to God, even if he wasn’t sure what God expected of him. 

🙏 This week, consider the areas of life where you face big obstacles. How can you invite God into them? Ask Him to help you grow, to give you the grace to persevere. Jesus wants to do incredible things with us through our work and relationships. We just have to open our hearts and let Him in. 

✝️ “I did not really know what God might expect of me in all details; nor did I know how much I could expect of myself. But that was precisely why I had resolved to accept all things, come what may, as from his hands.” - Fr. Walter Ciszek, He Leadeth Me

“What we tend to forget… is the very folksy truth that God by his Incarnation took on a human body …” 

✝️ Pain can be one of the greatest stumbling blocks to our faith, whether we or those near us experience it. And Jesus, as both human and divine, experienced this too. How can you talk to God about this?

🙏 💜 Ask Him for the ability to surrender to Him in the midst of it all.

Whatever your work looks like, trust that God can use it for His glory.

How is God calling you? How do you live out your vocation?

Join us in listening to today’s Surrender Story with Tammy Peterson 🙏💜

Today in Pray40, Tammy, wife of psychologist @jordan.b.peterson, shares her story of surrendering to God’s will for her life as she faced a rare and devastating prognosis. 

@tammy.m.peterson 

“The rosary became a sort of antidote to my self-reliance. It taught me to be calm, to listen to God, and to attend to the moment at hand. It taught me to be patient, and not to assert my own will, but to attend to what God wanted. As it does, it seemed to help me draw nearer to the Blessed Mother, too, and it helped me model the sort of docility she teaches us as her children …”🙏

Today on International Women’s Day and the premiere of the new Angel Studios film, Cabrini, check out the new collection of Mother Cabrini prayers on the app! Join us in learning about her life and praying with her words, guided by Sr. Eileen Currie, M.S.C. 🙏❤️

“My loving Jesus, I enclose myself in you and surrender myself completely in your loving Heart…Enlighten my mind with a ray of your light, move my heart and soul, and make me do whatever pleases you and is for your greater glory ...”  ✝️

In her 67-year life, Mother Cabrini helped found 67 institutions of care around the world, including orphanages, hospitals, convents, and schools. Known to many as St. Frances Xavier Cabrini, she founded the Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and was the first U.S. citizen to be canonized.

 🎬 Also, check out the new movie Cabrini from Angel Studios to really dive into Mother Cabrini’s life! It tells the story of her arrival in New York City in 1889 as an Italian immigrant, where she faced disease, crime, difficulty, and her own health struggles while fighting for housing and healthcare for society’s most vulnerable. The movie is in theaters starting today.

Week 5 Pray40: Freedom 

We’ll see Fr. Ciszek’s release from the worker camp, his new life in the Soviet Union, and his eventual return to the United States. We’ll pray together and reflect on true freedom in Christ and how we can find His peace no matter the situation. 🕊️🙏

This is our last week meditating on Fr. Ciszek’s inspiring life. Next week, we’ll switch gears to draw closer to the Passion of our Lord. ✝️

🙏 In these short clips, you’ll hear Fr. Ciszek describe his experience of being arrested, enduring interrogations, working in a labor camp, ministering to others, and finally returning home.

Imaginative Prayer: Burial of Jesus in the Tomb

”As we pray at the tomb today, bring with you whatever has been on your heart to surrender these last few weeks, whatever you have carried with you through this Lenten journey—a wound, a habit of sin, a desire for control, a doubt or disbelief.” 

🙏✝️ Join us in prayer tonight with Sr. Miriam as we rest with Jesus, meditating on the tomb and the Joyous Light that will come at Easter.

“Lord, no matter what You decide to do with Alyssa, I’ll never stop loving You.” - Today’s #SurrenderStory with Linda Maliani 💜
 
“As soon as I said this I felt an ache in my heart because I knew I was giving Him permission to take Alyssa. He didn’t need my permission, of course, but He wanted my surrender. At that moment, I surrendered my daughter to Him.”

🙏 When have you learned to love God and trust in His timing even when you couldn’t understand what He was doing in your life? #pray40

“If you remain in my word, you will truly be my disciples, and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” (John 8:31-32)

🙏✝️ We’ve entered the season of Passiontide, the final two weeks of Lent before Easter Sunday. In Pray40, we’ve turned our attention from He Leadeth Me to draw near to Jesus on the Cross, meditating on the key moments leading up to His Passion. 

Meditate with Jeff Cavins today on the Agony in the Garden. “The agony in the garden isn’t some meaningless walk through a garden for peace and quiet. This is a living metaphor where salvation works out in real time. This is the reason why Jesus feels extreme distress in prayer. He sits in the uncomfortable tension of embracing His cross.” 

What do you need to take and pray about in the proverbial garden? How can you grow even closer to Jesus these last 2 weeks of Lent before His Passion? 🙏💜

Today is the Solemnity of Joseph, Husband of Mary. 🙏

“O God, who in your inexpressible providence, were pleased to choose Saint Joseph as spouse of the most holy mother of your son. Grant we pray that we who revere him as our protector on earth may be worthy of his heavenly intercession through Christ our Lord. Amen.”

Join us in praying the full Litany of St. Joseph on the app today. 🙏❤️

This year, set the holiest days apart as a family.

Today’s Surrender Story with Lisa & Josh Canning 🙏💜 Listen to their powerful story today in Pray40 on depression, marriage, and relying on God.

“Whoever wishes to come after me must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me.” (Matthew 16:24) ✝️🙏

As we near the start of Holy Week, consider if and how you’re choosing Christ every day. How have you followed Him this Lent? 

“When we deny ourselves of the things that keep us from God, we’re better able to see the crosses God is calling us to carry.” (Pray40 with Mark Wahlberg)

#hallowapp #surrender

After 40 days and 40 nights in the desert, Jesus enters Jerusalem. #PalmSunday

As Fr. Mike says today in Pray40, now is truly the time that we enter the story. 

✝️

Holy Week has begun. Join us in prayer every day as we prepare for His ultimate loving sacrifice for us on the cross.

Through Their Eyes, a Triduum Challenge for kids and the whole family from @saints.alive.pod, starts tomorrow on Holy Thursday. 🙏💜

In this radio-drama mini-series geared towards families with kids 8 years and older, you’ll set apart these holy days and listen deeply to four powerful stories from the perspective of the saints. 

🥖🍷 Holy Thursday: enter into the Last Supper with St. Mark
✝️ Good Friday: touch the face of Jesus with St. Veronica
🐓 Holy Saturday: hear the cock crow with St. Peter
☀️ Easter Sunday: discover the empty tomb with St. Mary Magdalene

At the Foot of the Cross with Mary ✝️💙 #HolyWeek  Listen to our final imaginative prayer session of Pray40 today with Sr. Miriam.   “There’s a long tradition in theology and sacred art of comparing Mary’s suffering on Calvary to the pangs of childbirth. If it’s helpful for you, you can draw close to Mary today with this image in mind of a mother laboring in anguish for her child, cooperating with God’s plan for new life even in the midst of pain and suffering …”

@abidingtogetherpodcast🙏

“Because for me, it is evidence of the constant press of God’s love in the midst of our struggles and in the midst of our suffering.” - @sr_josephine

Today on Holy Thursday, join us in listening to this honest, powerful story of surrendering her life to God from Sr. Josephine Garrett. 🙏💜  ✝️ This is our final Surrender Story of Lent Pray40, and we’re so blessed that so many of you have listened to these stories of God’s love and mercy at work in the world and in our hearts.   You’ll have access to these stories beyond Pray40 after Easter Sunday — stay tuned. 🙏

HOLY THURSDAY 🙏🍷🥖

“This is my body that is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.”

“I give you a new commandment: love one another.”

“I have given you a model to follow, so that as I have done for you, you should also do.”

One of the most eventful and vital days in the liturgy of the Church, Holy Thursday commemorates the Last Supper of Jesus with His disciples, where He instituted both the Sacrament of the Holy Eucharist and the Sacrament of Holy Orders (the priesthood). ✝️

Join us in prayer tonight as we begin the Paschal Triduum. 🙏💜

Today on Good Friday, join us in praying the Stations of the Cross with @therealjimcaviezel ✝️

“Jesus Christ, You have made this journey to die for me with unspeakable love; and I have so many times ungratefully abandoned You. But now I love You with all my heart; and, because I love You, I am sincerely sorry for ever having offended You. Pardon me, my God, and permit me to accompany You on this journey. You go to die for love of me; I want, my beloved Redeemer, to die for love of You. My Jesus, I will live and die always united to You.”

Hi friends, today is Good Friday, the solemn day we reflect on the death of our savior Jesus Christ. ✝️

🕊️It’s through His sacrifice on the cross that we can seek and experience God’s mercy.  So I’d love to invite you to start the Divine Mercy Novena today on @hallowapp, as we pray for God’s mercy on the whole world for the next 9 days leading up to Divine Mercy Sunday. 

“You expired, Jesus, but the source of life gushed forth for souls, and the ocean of mercy opened up for the whole world. O Fount of Life, unfathomable Divine Mercy, envelop the whole world and empty Yourself out upon us.”🙏❤️

#goodfriday #triduum #holyweek #easter #hallowpartner #easter #divinemercy #shrine

Today on Good Friday, we turn our gaze to the cross to meditate on the Passion and Death of Jesus. Lent is over, and we have dwelled with Him in the desert for many weeks, reflecting on His surrender and hearing powerful testimonies of those who have surrendered their lives to Him. 🙏✝️

“You expired, Jesus, but the source of life gushed forth for souls, and the ocean of mercy opened up for the whole world. O Fount of Life, unfathomable Divine Mercy, envelop the whole world and empty Yourself out upon us.”

As we await His Resurrection on Easter Sunday, we invite you to start the Divine Mercy Novena led by @fathermikeschmitz today. Together we’ll pray for God’s mercy and love in the 9 days leading up to Divine Mercy Sunday. 

💙

'Time-beyond-time'

As we await His Resurrection, reflect on this powerful passage from Pope Benedict XVI. #HolySaturday 

“Even in the extreme darkness of the most absolute human loneliness, we may hear a voice that calls us and find a hand that takes ours and leads us out. Human beings live because they are loved and can love; and if love even penetrated the realm of death, then life also even reached there. In the hour of supreme solitude we shall never be alone …”

🙏✝️

Alleluia, Alleluia! He is Risen! Happy Easter! 🙏 Today we celebrate the greatest miracle in history, the Resurrection of our Savior, Jesus Christ. ✝️🕊️
 
🎶🎧 We’re so excited to share this new song from @mattmahermusic, “He Leadeth Me”! The song is inspired by Fr. Walter Ciszek’s life, and it’s the perfect way to conclude your Lent Pray40 journey and celebrate that Jesus is Risen!

“I surrender All God I give my life. I want to walk in the way, the truth of Jesus Christ. He promised where He is, I will also be. That where I am, He Leadeth Me.”

Listen to the full song on the app, exclusively on Hallow. 🙏💛

HE IS RISEN! 🙏✝️💛

“This is the heart of our faith.” - Pope St. John Paul II 

Alleluia, Alleluia! 🕊️

Happy Easter from all of us at Hallow. We're so blessed to pray with you! 🙏💜

Christ is risen! After 40 days and nights in the desert, we walk with Christ in the Resurrection. 
We’re celebrating today with so much joy with the release of my new song exclusively for the @hallowapp called He Leadeth Me. 🙏🎶
I was just blown away by Hallow’s Lent challenge and the incredible story of surrender told through the life of Fr. Walter Ciszek that I knew I needed to write a song about following Jesus and surrendering everything to Him. Here’s a sample, but you can check out the full song and several other songs of mine now on Hallow. 
Alleluia, alleluia! ✝️💜

Also! Join the waitlist for the upcoming Easter with the Early Church challenge, starting next Monday, April 8!   ✝️ We’ll take an in-depth look at the lives of the early Christians, following them down the dusty roads of the Roman Empire and into their humble homes that often served as places of worship. Well also reflect on why so many of them were willing to die for their faith. 

🙏💚 We’ll share more details this week, but in the meantime join the waitlist to walk with some incredible guides this Easter season to dive into the lives of some of the earliest followers of Christ.

Some behind the scenes from recording He Leadeth me for @hallowapp ✝️ #easter #heleadethme #catholicmusic #christianmusic #catholicprayer #hallowapp

“My child, life on earth is a struggle indeed; a great struggle for my kingdom. But fear not, because you are not alone. I am always supporting you, so lean on Me as you struggle, fearing nothing. Take the vessel of trust and draw from the fountain of life – for yourself, but also for other souls, especially such as are distrustful of My goodness.” (Jesus said to St. Faustina Kowalska - Diary, 1488)

💙🕊️

#divinemercy 

Jesus Christ, have mercy on us and on the whole world! 🙏💙 Hear the full musical chaplet on the app!

Easter with the Early Church starts this Monday! 🙏💚

We’re thrilled to share that this 3-week challenge is guided by @mattfradd, Fr. Malachy Napier, CFR, @georgehxanthis, and @patriciaheaton.
 
✝️🕊️Each day, we’ll meditate on the stories of the early Christians and a specific topic they exemplified in following Christ. And in seeing the transformational power of Christ’s Resurrection over the first 400 years of the Church, we’ll also ask God to transform our own lives along the way.

“You who say in silence: “Jesus, I trust in you” teach us that there is no faith more profound, no hope more alive and no love more ardent than the faith, hope and love of a person who in the midst of suffering places himself securely in God’s hands.” - Pope Benedict XVI #DivineMercySunday 🕊️💙

Happy Feast of Divine Mercy friends! A visceral reminder in our faith that God’s love and mercy is infinite. Brought to us through the  miraculous visions of St Faustina Kowalska in the early 20th century. “Jesus I trust in you.” Did you pray the novena? I did. 😊🙏🏽

And Happy second Sunday of Easter! 
🙏🏽✝️💗🕊️ #StayPrayedUp @hallowapp

It’s Day 1 of Easter with the Early Church! We begin today with the story of Mary Magdalene, the very first witness to the Resurrection. 🙏💚

”Mary Magdalene’s journey with Jesus began long before that first Easter morning. She initially encountered Him early in His public ministry. The Gospel of Luke tells us that Jesus exorcized seven demons from her and that she began to follow Him after that. Over the course of those three years, Mary Magdalene had a front-row seat to the life of Jesus – His miracles and teachings, the highs and lows that He experienced; times of sadness, exhaustion, frustration, joy, and triumph.” 

Listen to the full meditation, guided by @mattfradd, with prayer at the end of the session led by Fr. Malachy Napier, CFR, on the app today. 🕊️

Happy Easter everyone! Did you know that Easter actually lasts 50 days? It’s such a joyous time of year to celebrate the Resurrection of our Savior, which is why I am incredibly excited to share my new project with the @HallowApp. I will be leading meditations as part of Hallow’s Easter with the Early Church Prayer Challenge. ✝️

Throughout this series, we’re going to take an in-depth look at the lives of the early Christians. It’s going to be a wonderful time of growing closer to God. Download Hallow for free at hallow.com/patricia (link in bio). 

#easter #earlychurch #prayer #hallowpartner

“Then the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. Behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall name him Jesus …” 🙏

📣 The Solemnity of the Annunciation of the Lord commemorates the angel Gabriel’s appearance to the Virgin Mary. The word “Annunciation” might look similar to an English word that is more common: announce. The Annunciation refers to the announcement of the Incarnation–that God would become man in the form of Jesus, born to Mary. It also refers to Mary’s fiat–her yes to God.

Note: this solemnity is typically celebrated on March 25. Because it fell during Holy Week, we celebrate this holy day today! 💙

Read more about the Annunciation in our blog - linked to in stories!

“Come, Holy Spirit, send forth the heavenly radiance of your light.” (Veni Sancte Spiritus)

❤️‍🔥🕊️ In our story today, we saw the power of the Holy Spirit in the life of St. Peter, the first pope and a martyr of Christ. After Pentecost, the early Church experienced this power of the Holy Spirit, and they often called on Him to fill their hearts. 

That same Holy Spirit is available to us today. We can call on Him to heal what’s broken in our lives, to feel God’s presence in our hearts, and to be bold in sharing our faith. 🕊️

At the end of each Tuesday session in Easter with the Early Church, we’ll say a prayer to the Holy Spirit that was written or inspired by the early Church, with Fr. Malachy Napier as our guide. 🙏 @cfr_franciscans

Ephesians 4:11-16 🕊️✝️

“He himself granted that some are apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors and teachers to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, until all of us come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to maturity, to the measure of the full stature of Christ. 

We must no longer be children, tossed to and fro and blown about by every wind of doctrine by people’s trickery, by their craftiness in deceitful scheming; 

but speaking the truth in love, we must grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ, from whom the whole body, joined and knit together by every ligament with which it is equipped, as each part is working properly, promotes the body’s growth in building itself up in love.”

How do you build and support the body of Christ through love in your life? 🙏💚 #EasterwiththeEarlyChurch

Today in Easter with the Early Church, we’re meditating on this passage from the Didache with @georgehxanthis. 🙏

“[Be] humble since ‘the humble will inherit the earth.’ Be patient, merciful, harmless, quiet, and good; and always ‘have respect for the teaching’ you have been given. Do not put on airs or give yourself up to presumptuousness. Do not associate with the high and mighty; but be with the upright and humble. Accept whatever happens to you as good, in the realization that nothing occurs apart from God.” 🕊️💚

📜 The Didache was most likely written in the second century, and in the first few centuries of the early Church, some considered it a divinely inspired document and even equated it with Scripture. In Greek, Didache literally means “teaching.”

The document contains practical instructions about worship, prayer, ethics, Church leadership, fasting, and many other topics that are still observed in the Church today. 🙏

Reflect today on the friendship between Saints Felicity and Perpetua alongside @patriciaheaton 🙏💚 

“These two women are almost always invoked together. In artwork and stained glass windows, the pair go hand in hand. Their friendship alone is a testament to their counter-cultural perspective …”

Has a friend supported you in your spiritual journey? What can we learn from these two friends? Listen today and reflect with us 🕊️

Last week in Easter with the Early Church, we looked at the first disciples of Christ and what happened after they witnessed the Resurrection. ✝️

This week, we’ll turn to the next generation to hear what happened after the original followers of Jesus were no longer around. We’ll begin the week by meditating on the life of St. Justin Martyr—how he searched for truth, converted at age 30, and became an apologist. ✍️

🙏💚 “Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God—this is your true and proper worship. Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will.” (Romans 12:1-2)

Let’s take a moment today to ask God where we need the Holy Spirit the most in our lives right now. 💚

🙏

Save or share this short prayer: 🕊️ Holy Spirit, fill our hearts and make us new. 🕊️

"What profit is there for one to gain the whole world and forfeit his life?" (Mark 8:36) #feastday

“Just as fish die if they stay too long out of water, so the monks who loiter outside their prayer chambers or pass their time with men of the world lose the intensity of their inner peace. So, like a fish going toward the sea, we must hurry to reach our prayer chamber. If we delay outside, we will lose our interior watchfulness.” - St. Anthony of the Desert 

Take some time today to enter into silence with the Lord. 

Find rest in Him, and let Him restore you with His life-giving water.

As we approach the month of May, the month of Mary, we’re so excited to invite you to join the waitlist for 33 Days to Morning Glory, a new challenge and Marian Consecration guided by Sr. Miriam James Heidland! 🙏💙🕊️

Starting on Monday, May 6, this challenge takes us all the way through the popular devotion 33 Days to Morning Glory from the Marian Fathers @thedivinemercy! This challenge feels like a spiritual retreat or journey, with each meditation serving as a powerful way to start each day drawing near to Christ. 

We’ll pray together to entrust our hearts to Mary each morning, following Christ’s example and the powerful examples of St. Louis de Montfort, St. Maximilian Kolbe, Mother Teresa, and Pope St. John Paul II. 
 
After 33 days of preparation and prayer, we will dedicate our hearts to Jesus through Mary in a formal consecration on June 8, the Feast of Her Immaculate Heart. ❤️‍🔥🙏

“There is nothing we can desire or want that we do not find in God.” - St. Catherine of Siena 🙏❤️‍🔥🕊️ 

One of four female Doctors of the Church, St. Catherine of Siena, is known for her writings on mysticism and spiritual guidance and her efforts for Church unity in the fourteenth century. We celebrate her feast day today, April 29, the anniversary of her death.

“Every vocation is a ‘diamond in the rough’ that needs to be polished.” 

In his prayer intention this month, @franciscus reminds us that “a good priest, sister or nun, must above all else be a man, a woman who is formed.”

In The Pope Video that accompanies this message, which is entrusted to the Pope’s Worldwide Prayer Network, Pope Francis stresses the importance of an integral formation that “continues throughout life” and that should have “direct contact with the lives of other people.”

🙏 Let us together pray “that men and women religious, and seminarians, grow in their own vocational journey through human, pastoral, spiritual and community formation, that leads them to be credible witnesses of the Gospel.”

Tell your friends who are seminarians, novices, or religious!

The invitation of Marian consecration 
… to be fed, to be nurtured, to be loved, protected, and mothered. 
… to be made into saints.
And isn’t that all any of us truly desire? 

🙏😇Those things are all here for us, waiting in Mary’s beautiful heart. She is a refuge of sinners, and she is ready to receive us into her school of mercy. She will shelter us under her mantle as she teaches us about Him, who is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. Her only desire is to help us know her Son more deeply so that we may experience the fullness of life for which He made us. 

Join us in prayer TOMORROW in 33 Days to Morning Glory with our guide, Sr. Miriam James Heidland!

💙🙏🕊️

Catholics hold Mary in the highest esteem among all “creatures” (created beings), a respect distinct from that given to other saints. This special veneration is called “Hyperdulia,” a term that emphasizes the absence of worship. It stems from Mary’s singular role in salvation history: she is the Theotokos, the God-bearer, the woman chosen by God to bear His Son, Jesus Christ. This unique role imbues her with exceptional grace and holiness.

I’ll be renewing my consecration to Jesus through Mary this May on the @hallowapp with Sr. Miriam James as we go through 33 Days to Morning Glory with Fr. Michael Gaitley. When I made this consecration back in 2019, It was a game changer for my relationship with our mother, Mary. I highly recommend you join us!

The potential for extremes in Marian devotion is acknowledged. “Marian excess” elevates Mary to a position equal to God, attributing divine qualities to her. This is a theological error. Conversely, “Marian defect” disregards Mary’s significance and her perfect cooperation with God’s plan. Both extremes are deviations from Catholic teaching.

The Church in no way allows devotion to Mary to “eclipse” or “overshadow” our relationship with God! Devotion to Mary is always to allow us to have an even deeper relationship with Jesus. Who better could help us do that than his own mother whom he gave to us as our own mother in John 19:26-27.

Today is the first day of 33 Days to Morning Glory! Listen in today for an introduction to St. Louis de Montfort, an inspiring saint and the pioneer of Marian Consecration, guided by Sr. Miriam James Heidland. 🙏

❤️‍🔥“Do we have a fire in our hearts as we begin this retreat?” - 33 Days to Morning Glory

For 33 Days, we’ll journey through the spiritual retreat and book from @thedivinemercy to draw near to the heart of Mary to meet Christ face-to-face and experience the renewal of our hearts in Him - we hope you’ll join us!

“Mary’s role is to bring us face to face with the love in the Heart of Jesus crucified. But what if when we’re there with Him, “face to face,” we don’t feel moved? What if we stand before a crucifix, ponder the Lord’s Passion, and feel little or nothing? What if our hearts are hard and insensitive because of our sins? This happens. We all sin, and sin hardens hearts. Aridity and desolation also happen, regardless of our sins. Whatever the reason, our hearts can be cold and unfeeling, and this can be a problem. Thankfully, the one who has a sinless, perfect, immaculate heart will help us. She’ll give us her compassionate heart. She’ll even let us live in her heart! If only we’ll give her ours.” - 33 Days to Morning Glory  Are you ready to give over your heart? 🙏❤️

Today, we will continue to learn about St. Louis De Montfort's life and devotions as we grow in deeper intimacy with our Mama Mary.

“Come, Holy Spirit, living in Mary. Prepare me to give myself fully to living out this true and solid devotion. Amen.”

Are you praying these 33 Days to Morning with us? 🙏💙

Wherever you find yourself today, just take some time to share with God what’s on your heart. He is here. And He sees you, and He wants to hear you. And He loves you. 🙏💙 #morningglory #godlovesyou

“Be imbued with the hope that is so much a part of the mystery of the Ascension of Jesus. 

Be deeply conscious of Christ’s victory and triumph over sin and death. Realize that the strength of Christ is greater than our weakness, greater than the weakness of the whole world. 

Try to understand and share the joy that Mary experienced in knowing that her Son had taken his place with his Father, whom he loved infinitely. 

And renew your faith today in the promise of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has gone to prepare a place for us, so that he can come back again and take us to himself. This is the mystery of the Ascension of our Head. Let us always remember: Jesus gave instructions, and then Jesus took his place. Amen.”

- Pope St. John Paul II #AscensionoftheLord

Family Mass Prep goes to Rome!

This week, we’re recording some future FMP episodes on @hallowapp from Roman rooftops, so tune in & prepare to hear the Sunday readings with a little Vatican spin.

Happy Mother's Day! ❤️

“My Immaculate Heart will be your refuge and the way that will lead you to God.” - Mary to Lucia, the Second Apparition at Fátima

🙏💙🕊️

On May 13, 1917, Mary appeared to three children of Fátima, Portugal — cousins Lucia, Francisco, and Jacinta – and said she would appear on the 13th of each month for the next five months. This Marian apparition led to the Blessed Mother’s title of Our Lady of Fátima.

Join us in Week 2 of 33 Days to Morning Glory, meditating on the life of St. Maximilian Kolbe. “Our little, little mother, the Immaculate Mary can do anything for us. We are her children. Turn to her. She will overcome everything.” 

If you’re not familiar with this courageous saint, his story is incredibly powerful. As a young boy, Mary appeared to St. Maximilian Kolbe, offering him two crowns - one white for purity and one red for martyrdom. He accepted them both and eventually received both. 

He went on to start the Militia Immaculata to share the love of Christ with the whole world under Mary’s guidance and later died a martyr in the place of a prisoner condemned in WWII. ❤️

St. Maximilian Kolbe’s life was truly marked with courage. This week, we’ll reflect on his life and see how entrusting our lives to Mary doesn’t necessarily make them easier, but trusting in her love and guidance leads us closer to Christ and a life lived for Him. 🙏🕊️

✨ We’re so excited to share the new Daily Holy Spirit with Fr. Dave Pivonka, president of @franciscanuniversity, just in time for Pentecost! This new daily with Fr. Dave leads you to encounter the Holy Spirit, the third person of the Trinity, in prayer every single day through bite-sized meditations. 

🕊️ ”Daily dose of the Holy Ghost” - @franciscanpresident 🕊️  

We’ll meditate on the grace the Spirit bestows on us, how it can transform our lives, and so much more. ☀️🙏 Add the Daily Holy Spirit to your morning prayer routine on the app and start every day enveloped in the grace of the Holy Spirit!

#comeholyspirit

“And I just would like to invite you just to take a moment in this little picture, and just imagine yourself offering something to Mary. Would you be willing to maybe offer her one of the most beloved parts of your life? And just to notice what happens as you do that… as you watch her just very reverently and just very kindly receive them from you; she knows how important they are to you …”

Today’s meditation in Morning Glory with Sr. Miriam — Mary, Our Mother, pray for us. 🙏💙

“The Church of Christ is always, so to speak, in a situation of Pentecost she is always gathered in the Upper Room in prayer, and at the same time, driven by the powerful wind of the Spirit, she is always on the streets preaching. The Church is kept ever young and alive, one, holy, catholic and apostolic, because the Spirit constantly descends upon her in order to remind her of all that the Lord has said to her (cf. Jn 14:25) and to guide her into the fullness of truth (cf. Jn 16:13).” - Pope St. John Paul II 

🕊️🔥 Today we celebrate the Holy Spirit coming descending upon the Apostles, as Jesus said it would, as well as the birth of the Church! #PentecostSunday

Tens of thousands will gather in Indianapolis this July for the 10th National Eucharistic Congress as part of the National Eucharistic Revival.🚶As part of the Congress, four groups of pilgrims are making their way to Indianapolis on foot, starting from Brownsville (TX), Bemidji (MN), San Francisco (CA), and Bridgeport (CT) in a Eucharistic pilgrimage. 

Whether you’re attending the Congress or just interested in learning more, we’re excited to share a new daily meditation focused on the Eucharist and stories in American Catholicism! 🇺🇸🙏

Each Monday, we’ll zoom in on where one group is and hear the story of a holy site or person they’ll be visiting. For the remaining days of the week, we’ll pray with eucharistic meditations, learn about the foundations of the Mass, pray the Rosary and Divine Mercy Chaplet with Jonathan Roumie, and meditate with music focused on the Eucharist from artists like Matt Maher and Kat Hammock! 🙏💜🎶

Soon, over 30,000 people will gather together in Indianapolis July 17-21 for this incredible event, and we are proud to be part of it! Learn more and register for the Eucharistic Congress in Indianapolis with us!

“Jesus wants me to tell you again … how much love He has for each one of you — beyond all you can imagine. I worry some of you still have not really met Jesus — one-to-one — you and Jesus alone.” - Mother Teresa 🙏❤️

In Week 3 of 3 Days to Morning Glory, we’re praying alongside Mother Teresa. Listen in for a clip of a powerful meditation with Sr. Miriam!

”… It just absolutely tugs on the most tender places in my heart. And I just want to extend her invitation to you: No matter who you are, no matter what experiences you’ve had in your life, no matter what you’re facing right now, would you be willing just to take a moment and just to sit with the immense love that Jesus has for you? One to one… You and Jesus alone…”

New waitlist: Sacred Heart Novena! ❤️‍🔥  We’ll pray together every day leading up to the Solemnity of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus. This nine-day devotion is such a powerful way to experience Jesus’ grace and a renewal of our hearts in Him - starting Wednesday, May 29. 

🙏 Each day we’ll hear a short story about the Sacred Heart devotion, and then we’ll pray the traditional novena prayers. As you prepare to begin, consider what’s on your heart that you can unite in the heart of Jesus. How can you trust in His mercy and love to take care of you?

“In the Sacred Heart, every treasure of wisdom and knowledge is hidden. In that divine heart beats God’s infinite love for everyone and for each of us as individuals.” - Pope St. John Paul II

"Rise, you who were lying fast asleep...Rise and hurry to the Church: Here is the Father; here is the Son; here is the Holy Spirit.” - St. Ambrose #MostHolyTrinity

“No one has greater love than this, to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.” (John 15:13) 🙏🇺🇸 #MemorialDay

"To you, Mary, I repeat: Totus tuus ego sum." - Pope St. John Paul II 

Are you still praying with us in the 33 Days to Morning Glory challenge? We love this quote from JPII. 

To Jesus through Mary. 🙏💙

It’s the first day of the Sacred Heart Novena! Join us today as we pray for a renewal of our hearts in Jesus over the next 9 days leading up to the Solemnity of His Sacred Heart. 🙏

❤️‍🔥O my Jesus, you have said: “Truly I say to you, ask and you will receive, seek and you will find, knock and it will be opened to you.”❤️‍🔥

What needs and intentions are you giving over to Jesus in this novena?

“I need nothing but God, and to lose myself in the heart of Jesus.” - St. Margaret Mary Alacoque

🙏❤️‍🔥

“May Your Heart dwell always in my heart, and may Your Precious Blood ever flow in the veins of my soul.” - St. Francis de Sales 🙏❤️‍🔥  Day 2: Sacred Heart Novena - it’s not too late to join us in praying this powerful devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus!   What do you need to let go of to make your heart a a dwelling place for Him?

Happy Feast of the Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary! 🙏💙

Today, Mary’s visit to Elizabeth after the Angel Gabriel came to Mary and announced that she would be the Mother of Jesus. Elizabeth recognized this blessing from God and acknowledged Mary’s faith by saying, “Blessed are you who believed that what was spoken to you by the Lord would be fulfilled.” 

Did you know that Pope Benedict XVI once called the Visitation the first Eucharistic procession in history?

”In a certain way we can say that her journey was ... the first "Eucharistic procession" in history. Mary, living Tabernacle of God made flesh, is the Ark of the Covenant in whom the Lord visited and redeemed his people. Jesus' presence filled her with the Holy Spirit.” - Pope Benedict XVI 

How can you carry Jesus in your heart to imitate Mary and share this joy with friends and family?

“Oh, my darling, think, then, that Jesus is there in the Taber­nacle expressly for you, for you alone; He is burning with the de­sire to enter your heart.” - St. Thérèse of Lisieux #CorpusChristi

🍷🥖 Today we celebrate the Solemnity of the Most Holy Body and Blood of Christ — Jesus is here with us throughout all of eternity, present in the Blessed Sacrament. 

This sacrifice is a constant reminder of His boundless love for us. ❤️‍🔥

#MostSacredHeartofJesus 🙏❤️‍🔥

“Mary, I give you my heart. Please set it on fire with love for Jesus. Make it always attentive to His burning thirst for love and for souls. Keep my heart in your most pure Heart that I may love Jesus and the members of His Body with your own perfect love.” - 33 Days to Morning Glory  Yesterday many people began consecrating their hearts to Jesus through Mary in 33 Days to Morning Glory. Thank you to everyone who joined us and Sr. Miriam in this powerful journey to grow closer to Christ and His Mother. We’re grateful today and always that you’ve invited us into your faith journey. 🙏💙

“If Jesus is the Word, the logos, the mind of God, He is inviting us to ‘come and see’ how God feels about us, how God loves, how God lives in our world.”

📖🙏 Join us on this beautiful adventure through the Gospel of John with @jeffcavins and @jonathanroumieofficial, starting tomorrow! 

Let us know what you’re most excited about for this 21-day challenge! ⬇️

📖🙏Journey through John with @jeffcavins and @jonathanroumieofficial starts today!!    “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things came to be through him, and without him nothing came to be. What came to be through him was life, and this life was the light of the human race; the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.”(John 1:1-5) 

🦅 We’ll spend 21 days (1 chapter a day) reflecting deeply on John’s Gospel and how he seeks to paint a separate portrait of who Christ is—one that’s different from the other Gospels—and how He demonstrates His divinity. 

Don’t miss this powerful scripture series to stay rooted or jump back into the Word in this summer! ✝️🙏

Hey friends, I want to invite you to join me in the newest challenge on the @hallowapp launching today called Journey Through John. 🙏🏽💜 I’m joined by my friend @jeffcavins for a daily deep dive on the Gospel of John.

“Do whatever He tells you.” (John 2:5) #JourneythroughJohn

In today’s meditation, we hear about the Wedding at Cana — Jesus’s first miracle. 🍷 Did you know this miracle is only found in John’s Gospel?

✝️🙏 Inspired by this sign of Jesus’ divinity and love for us, in what ways can you ‘do whatever He tells you’?

🌎 JOHN 3:16. “For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him might not perish but might have eternal life.” 🌎
 Today’s meditation takes us through the third chapter of John, in which we hear this famous—maybe the most famous—verse from scripture. 

We invite you to consider 3 questions today as you listen to #JourneythroughJohn, 

Do we live like John 3:16 is true?  
Do we live as though we’re deeply loved by God?  
Do we believe in Him as though our salvation depends on it?  🙏❤️

“Christians must lean on the Cross of Christ just as travelers lean on a staff when they begin a long journey.” - St. Anthony of Padua #FeastDay

🕊️ Born in Portugal in 1195, St. Anthony became a massively popular Franciscan friar who died in Padua, Italy, in 1231. He traveled extensively preaching the word of Christ in places like Morocco. 

✝️ Despite living just 35 years, St. Anthony’s impact was far-reaching and significant. He was such a powerful preacher that he sometimes attracted crowds of 30,000 people. 

🙏 He was also known as a great miracle worker, having more than a dozen miracles associated with him, both during his time on earth and from heaven. To this day, people all over ask for St. Anthony’s intercession, including most famously in moments when they’ve lost something or are looking for something.

🔍 “Dear St. Anthony, please come around: something is lost, and it cannot be found.”

Good luck & prayers up for @jrue_holiday11 in the NBA Finals tonight. ☘️🏀

We’re always inspired by your faith and trust in God.

“I try to take it and leave it in God’s hands. I try to do what He wants me to do and come out here and perform the best I can for my teammates.” 🙏💚

About 4 years ago, I found out about the @hallowapp , and ever since then it has been helping me pray. Now, I use it almost everyday and the more I explore the app the more I realize just how much encouraging, and enlightening content is featured on it. I’d highly encourage you to give it a try. You can use the link in my bio (@truthcharting) to get a 3 month free trial. But if you do give it a try, make sure you actually go through and look at all of the content. For years I only used Hallow to help me pray a few daily prayers like the Rosary - but since the sponsorship, I’ve made it a point to actually browse everything the app has to offer and all I can say is wow. The more I use the app, the more I realize just how beneficial it is to my life. 

Here’s a list of the audio content used in this video:

- The Gospel of Matthew - Jonathan Roumie

- Imaginative Prayer - Sr. Miriam James Heidland

- Pentecost - Fr. Josh Johnson

- Daily Holy Spirit - Fr. Dave Pivonka

- Divine Mercy Novena - Fr. Mike Schmitz

- Daily Psalm - Bishop Robert Barron

"While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.” (John 9:5) #JourneyThroughJohn

✨💙

🙏 How can we choose to be like the blind man? 

🙏 How can we allow Christ to touch us, to open our eyes, and to inspire us to share His works with all who will listen?

🙏 How can the works of God might be made known through us?

Jesus said to him, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. If you know me, then you will also know my Father. From now on you do know him and have seen him.” (John 14:6-7) 🙏🕊️✝️

We believe prayer can change the world, which is why today we’re absolutely thrilled to announce a new feature on the app: Prayer Campaigns! You can now dedicate your prayer and meditation to a special intention or share one of your own with the community. 🙏💜🌎

Join the new waitlist for Witness to Hope, journeying through the Life of St. John Paul II with @therealjimcaviezel, Msgr. James Shea & @jackiefrancois!   Starting Monday, July 15, this challenge draws on the famous biography Witness to Hope written by George Weigel. We’ll hear how St. John Paul II’s path to the papacy was actually quite unlikely. He came from the working class in Poland, lost each of his family members by age 21, went through university and seminary under the Nazis, and suffered setbacks and persecution under the Communists. In 1978, Cardinal Karol Wojtyla became the leader of over 750 million Catholics, taking the name John Paul II. 🙏

Over 3 weeks, we’ll dive into the stories that led him to becoming Pope, meditating on his life and his love for adventure. Join the waitlist today and invite friends and family to join you!

It is Jesus who stirs in you the desire to do something great with your lives, the will to follow an ideal, the refusal to allow yourselves to be grounded down by mediocrity, the courage to commit yourselves humbly and patiently to improving yourselves and society.” - St. John Paul II

“We are not the sum of our weaknesses and failures; we are the sum of the Father's love for us and our real capacity to become the image of his Son." - St. John Paul II 🙏🕊️

There’s still time to join the waitlist for Witness to Hope, looking at the Life of St. John Paul II with @therealjimcaviezel, Msgr. James Shea, and @jackiefrancois! 

Pope St. John Paul II remains a beacon of faith and activism today. He championed human rights and challenged communist oppression, particularly in his native Poland. 🇵🇱

A charismatic world traveler, he was loved by millions and tirelessly promoted peace and social justice as pope.

We’re so excited to bring you this challenge where we journey through his life. If you're new to Hallow, Witness to Hope is all about bringing one of the most beloved saints to life through stories full of God’s grace and glory. 🕊️

“It is Jesus in fact that you seek when you dream of happiness ... It is Jesus who stirs in you the desire to do something great with your lives, the will to follow an ideal, the refusal to allow yourselves to be grounded down by mediocrity, the courage to commit yourselves humbly and patiently to improving yourselves and society.” - St. John Paul II ✝️ 

Do something great with your life! Join the challenge to learn and pray with us on the life of Pope St. John Paul II for 21 days, starting tomorrow. 💙🕊️

Pope St. John Paul II earned the nickname “The Pilgrim Pope”. During his 27-year papacy, he visited 129 countries, far more than any previous pope. John Paul II became the first pope to set foot in many countries, particularly those that had been isolated or fallen under communist rule. This spread his message of peace and faith to new audiences. These travels racked up over 700,000 miles, the equivalent of circling the Earth nearly 30 times! This dedication and tireless travel physically embodied his commitment to connecting with a global Catholic community.

Unlike previous popes, John Paul II embraced modern media to amplify his message. He used television and radio appearances during his travels to reach a wider audience than ever before. This global reach gave his message a powerful impact.

Big thanks to @hallowapp for sponsoring Truth Charting therealjimcaviezel, @jackiefrancois & Msgr. Shea are walking us through the life of Pope St. John Paul II, “Witness to Hope” is live NOW on Hallow and you can get a 3 month free trial by clicking the link in my bio.

🏔️ “Verso L’Alto!” 

🧗‍♂️ Today, we will hear our first episode about the life of someone still on their way to sainthood! And as it so happens, this Blessed will become a Saint next year! His seemingly simple story of holy friendship, generosity and zeal for Christ has spread throughout the world and he is known and loved by many of you, our listeners. So, come listen to Luciana tell the story of her brother, the explosion of joy himself: Blessed Pier Giorgio Frassati.

DAY 1: WITNESS TO HOPE! 🙏

“There is no evil to be faced that Christ does not face with us. There is no enemy that Christ has not already conquered. There is no cross to bear that Christ has not already carried for us and does not bear with us now. Be not afraid!” - St. Pope John Paul II 🙏✝️

With @therealimcaviezel, Msgr. Shea, and @jackiefrancois as our guides — let’s jump into reflecting on the life of St. John Paul II’s life for 21 days, meditating on his love for people, adventure, family, and really just getting to the heart of who this extraordinary man, pope, and saint was. 

Whether John Paul spoke in front of a million people or just one person, he spoke to people’s hearts. From his training as an actor, he knew how to deliver a message that transformed his audience. Did you know that if you put everything John Paul II wrote in his lifetime together, it would equal the length of 20 Bibles? Pray with us today. 🕊️📖

Day 2: Witness to Hope Challenge - it’s not too late to join us in learning about the life of Pope St. John Paul II and praying to the Holy Spirit. 💜

This is a beautiful opportunity to talk to God and ask Him for the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit! 📖

#witnessto hope #jpii #popejohnpaullii #faithjourney

We recently had the opportunity to visit JSerra High School in San Juan Capistrano, CA, and meet with their students and faculty. Being one of our very first Hallow Partner schools, it was incredible to hear about Jserra’s experience praying with Hallow in and out of the classroom. 🎒🙏💜 @jserralions   “Before we had Hallow on our campus, I felt ill-equipped to help students get to a place where they felt confident in their prayer life. Now, we get feedback from students saying ‘I’m praying for the first time consistently.” - Anna White, Theology chair at JSerra Catholic High School
 “I think Hallow has been one of the greatest answered prayers as a theology teacher...I have a place to point students toward when they ask me one of the top three questions I get as a theology teacher, which is, how do I pray?”

📚🙏 Our hope for all of our Hallow for School partnerships is to help students and educators to find peace and encounter God through prayer and grow deeper in their relationship with Him.

Is there a school you feel could benefit from the Hallow for Schools program? We’d be so grateful if you referred them to us. Not only will you make a massive difference in the lives of students and educators, but if a school you refer chooses to partner with Hallow, we’ll be happy to provide you with a free Hallow subscription for a year! 🙏💜

#Saintsin7Days is back for its 3rd installment, and we’re absolutely thrilled to kick off this year’s series with Joe Mazzulla, Head Coach of NBA Champions Boston Celtics! 🏀☘️ 
 
Starting in just one week, Joe Mazzulla will guide us through 7 meditations on St. Sebastian, the patron saint of athletes. 🙏💪 We’ll take an in-depth look at St. Sebastian’s life as a soldier in the Roman army and meditate on striving for excellence.

Joe will also talk about what it’s like to be a coach in the NBA and staying grounded in the truth, through wins and losses, celebrations and hardships.

Join the waitlist today for this first of four #Saintsin7Days!!

"[My faith] is my anchor.” - Joe Mazzulla ✝️

The first challenge in the upcoming #Saintsin7Days series starts next Monday, with Boston Celtics’ Head Coach, Joe Mazzulla. For 1 week, we'll walk through the life of St. Sebastian! 🙏

Coach Joe Mazzulla will also reflect on his life and career and the ways he has overcome adversity. 🏀 ☘️ As an NBA coach, daily prayer and meditation are so important for him—to stay grounded in his faith. 

Before games, Joe Mazzulla often takes time in solitude to reflect and pray. 🙏 He usually heads out to the court and walks around the perimeter, praying the Rosary and meditating on the mysteries of Jesus’ life. 

Join the St. Sebastian #Saintsin7Days waitlist today!

“He who carries God in his heart bears heaven with him wherever he goes.” - St. Ignatius of Loyola #FeastDay 🙏🕊️

As you wait for Saint in 7 Days to kick off on Monday, join us today in praying the Ignatian Spiritual Exercises with guide Fr. Timothy Gallagher, one of the greatest experts on prayer. 

📝⛵️Over 500 years old, the Spiritual Exercises remain one of the most powerful and practical teachings in our spiritual tradition. We couldn’t recommend them enough! You’ll also see a variety of other prayers and series on St. Ignatius featured on the app today.

“Nothing else is required than to act toward God, in the midst of your occupations, as you do, even when busy, toward those who love you and whom you love.” - St. Alphonsus Liguori #FeastDay 🙏💙

St. Alphonsus Liguori is the patron saint of moral theologians and a Doctor of the Church. He had a particular love for “practical spirituality” – to make spirituality accessible to everyone.

He established the Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer (Redemptorists) to reach out to the marginalized and spread God's love. ✝️

St. Alphonsus Liguori's legacy is one of mercy, compassion, and practical spirituality. His teachings continue to inspire and guide us. 🕯️

#alphonsusliguori #saintalphonsusliguori

“Let us therefore approach the throne of grace with boldness, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.” Hebrews 4:16 🙏

It’s Day 1 of St. Sebastian #Saintsin7Days with Joe Mazzulla, Head Coach of the NBA Champions Boston Celtics! 🏀☘️

Pray today and reflect on the life of St. Sebastian, the patron saint of athletes and a martyr of the Church. Throughout the week, we’ll hear Joe Mazzulla reflect on experiences in his career, how he handles wins and losses, and staying grounded in his faith, meditating on the model that St. Sebastian gives to us as Christians. 

Listen to Day 1 today! 🙏

#joemazzulla #saintsebastian #joemazzullachristian #bostonceltics

Have you listened to Day 1 of #Saintsin7Days yet? Join Joe Mazzulla, Head Coach of the Boston Celtics, guiding us through the life of St. Sebastian! 💚🙏

While the journeys of the saints to sainthood were filled with God’s grace and glory, they also included human struggles, great suffering, and a profound need for God’s mercy. By walking alongside the saints, we hope to see how God calls each of us to sainthood as well. 

Each day this week, we’ll lay out a mini-biography of the life of St. Sebastian, focusing on a different chapter of his life. Joe Mazzulla will also add reflections from his life where he’s had to rely on the Lord. Finally, we’ll reflect on what God may be telling us and spend time with Him in prayer. 

#joemazzulla #saintsebastian #joemazzullachristian #bostonceltics

“You were transfigured on the mountain, and your disciples, as much as they were capable of it, beheld your glory, O Christ our God, so that when they should see you crucified they would understand that your Passion was voluntary, and proclaim to the world that you truly are the splendor of the Father.” (CCC 555)

Today is the Feast of the Transfiguration of the Lord! ⛰️🙏 We remember when Jesus revealed his divinity to his closest disciples, as we hear in the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke.

The Transfiguration serves as a preview of Jesus' glory. It strengthened His disciples' faith before the trials of His Passion and Resurrection ✝️ It's a reminder of God's presence in each of our lives – a symbol of our hope in Him.

“Do not be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that you may prove what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.” (Romans 12:2) #Saintsin7Days

In today’s meditation, Joe Mazzulla reflects on the pressure of measuring up to the world’s standards versus God’s. 📖

“As an NBA coach, it can be easy to get caught up in what the world says about me, whether my team wins, or loses. That’s one of the reasons why daily prayer and meditation are so important for me—to stay grounded in the unchanging truth of who I am in God.” - Joe Mazzulla

We had such a great weekend hosting @hallowapp for their Summit! And what a way to close out our summer conference season!

Next up in our Saints in 7 Days series is Saint Maximillian Kolbe also known as the “Saint of Auschwitz.” 🙏

This Franciscan priest gave his life to spare another man and died at the hands of the Nazis amidst one of the greatest horrors of the 20th century.

Join the waitlist for this challenge, in which you’ll learn more about the incredible life of St. Maximilian Kolbe with @jonathanroumieofficial 

“Let us not forget that Jesus not only suffered, but also rose in glory; so, too, we go to the glory of the Resurrection by way of suffering and the Cross.” - St. Maximilian Kolbe

#maximiliankolbe #Saintsin7Days #saintmaximiliankolbe

Few saints are more associated with heroic sacrifice than Maximilian Kolbe, and for good reason. His incredible life offers us a powerful witness to the courage that following Christ requires. 🙏

The tender gaze of Mary had converted the heart of him as a little boy. His devotion to her helped him to become a man committed to “love without limits,” ready and willing to sacrifice all he had for the good of another. 💜

Join us tomorrow, August 12th for #Saintsin7Days where @jonathanroumieofficial will be guiding us through the story of St. Maximilian Kolbe’s life! 📖

It’s Day 1 of journeying through the life of St. Maximilian Kolbe with @jonathanroumieofficial! 🕊️

Although there are no words to fully capture this saint’s courage, here is what Francis Gajowniczek, the man whose life was spared because of St. Maximilian Kolbe, had to say about the moment that Fr. Kolbe took his place:

“Prisoners were never allowed to speak. So I could only thank him with my eyes. I could hardly grasp what was going on. The immensity of it. I, the condemned, was to live, and someone else willingly and voluntarily offered up his life for me, a complete stranger.”

Over the course of these next seven days, we’ll explore what made St. Maximilian Kolbe the generous, bold, and selfless man we encounter in the story of his death.

Jonathan Roumie will also lead us through reflections to discern what God may be telling us and spend time with Him in prayer. 😇

#saintsin7days

Hey friends, today’s the day! Here’s a sneak peek at the newest #Saints in 7 Days challenge on the @hallowapp where we will pray through the life of St. Maximilian Kolbe. This Polish Franciscan priest led an extraordinary life for God, even to his last moment, becoming a martyr at the Nazi death camp of Auschwitz. We’ll learn about his early years, religious life, and his incredible witness under Nazi imprisonment. St. Maximilian Kolbe has been a profound inspiration to me, so it’s an honor to lead you through his incredible story. I look forward to you joining me.

Have you ever heard the quote: “You have made us for yourself, O Lord, and our heart is restless until it rests in you.”? Or what about “To fall in love with God is the greatest romance; to seek Him, the greatest adventure and to find Him, the greatest human achievement”?

 These beautiful quotes are from the incredible Saint, Augustine of Hippo. And before he was a saint, Augustine was nothing short of a ruffian and rebel. It was only by the grace of God that he went on to become saint and doctor of the church! And we will tell his story...but! Not yet. First, we have to start with the story of the one that prayed Augustine into the arms of God, the woman who wept and fought for his holiness: Augustine’s mother, Saint Monica.

“Let us not forget that Jesus not only suffered, but also rose in glory; so, too, we go to the glory of the Resurrection by way of suffering and the Cross.” -St. Maximilian Kolbe 🙏✝️

Today is the feast of St. Maximilian Kolbe, Priest and Martyr. He is the patron saint of journalists, media communications, prisoners, the family and the chemically addicted.

As a Franciscan priest and missionary in Poland 🇵🇱, he published anti-Nazi works during the German occupation, hid thousands of Jews and refugees from captivity, and was arrested. 

After his arrest, Kolbe was sent to Auschwitz, one of the most brutal concentration camps, where he continued to minister as a priest, providing spiritual guidance to fellow inmates. He eventually volunteered to be tortured in place of another inmate who had a family at home. 

Join us in #Saintsin7Days to learn more about this courageous saint.

#saintmaximiliankolbe #mariandevotion

“God’s temple in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant could be seen in the temple. A great sign appeared in the sky, a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.” (Revelation 11:19-12:1) 👑 #Assumption

Today is the Solemnity of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, when we remember Mary, the mother of Jesus, who was taken body and soul into heaven at the end of her earthly life. On this Holy Day of Obligation, we recognize Mary’s unique role in God’s plan and her ultimate glorification. 💙

Pray this Assumption with the Rosary or even start the 54 Day Rosary Novena on Hallow!

We’re thrilled to announce our third saint in this year’s Saints in 7 Days series – St. Elizabeth Ann Seton guided by @byrheawahlberg starting on Monday, August 19th! 💜

In her short life, Elizabeth was many things. We know her as the first U.S. citizen to be canonized and also the foundress of Catholic schools in the United States. 🇺🇸

Elizabeth was even both a mother and a religious sister. Her journey was full of twists and turns, but she handled the challenges life threw at her with grace, which is why she serves as a model for many.

Join the new waitlist to listen to her incredible story! 🕊️

“The gate of heaven is very low; only the humble can enter it.” -St. Elizabeth Ann Seton

“The LORD is my shepherd; there is nothing I lack.” (Psalm 23)

Join us tomorrow, August 19th for #Saintsin7Days where @byrheawahlberg will be introducing us to St. Elizabeth Ann Seton’s story! 💜

#elizabethannseton #catholicschools

It’s Day 1 of St. Elizabeth Ann Seton’s #Saintsin7Days with @byrheawahlberg!

Each day this week, we’ll lay out a mini-biography of the life of St. Elizabeth Ann Seton, focusing on a different chapter of her life. Rhea Wahlberg will lead us through meditations on her life and what we can learn from it. 

At the end of each meditation, we’ll close in prayer with Psalm 23 – a Psalm that so often brought comfort to Elizabeth. 🕊️

Listen to Day 1 today! 🙏

Join us today! @rheawahlberg will be guiding us through the life of St. Elizabeth Ann Seton. 🙌

St. Elizabeth Ann Seton faced many obstacles in her short life. From the earliest days of her childhood, she experienced loss after loss, including two of her own children. She also suffered material poverty and extreme persecution. 

Yet, she held tightly to her deep love for God and her conviction to uphold the truth. She refused to run away when that truth cost her. Her entire life was an offering to God. We will journey through her life with a daily chapter this week, meditating on her love for the Lord.

We can’t wait to see you there! ✝️

“Our God loves us—that is our comfort. We have every true consolation and must leave all to Him.” - St. Elizabeth Ann Seton 💜

In today’s meditation, @byrheawahlberg walks us through a reflection on things of the world that we may place our comfort and security in.

In St. Elizabeth Ann Seton’s young adult, socialite life, she saw those around her getting married, starting families, and growing their wealth. So often, we believe this type of achievement or status will fulfill us. Are there moments you have believed something other than the Lord would satisfy your heart? 🙏

#catholicschools #motherseton

“A saint is not someone who never sins, but one who sins less and less frequently and gets up more and more quickly.” - St. Bernard of Clairvaux #FeastDay 🙏💜

St. Bernard of Clairvaux is a Doctor of the Church, and the patron saint of beekeepers, bees, and candlemakers. 🐝🕯️

As the founder of the Cistercian Order, he emphasized a return to the simplicity of monastic life, focusing on prayer, contemplation, and manual labor.

Bernard was a mystic and a theologian and deeply devoted to the Blessed Virgin Mary. His writings on Marian devotion are considered classics. ✝️🏛️

#bernardofclairvaux #saintbernard

“We must pray without ceasing, in every occurrence and employment of our lives - that prayer which is rather a habit of lifting up the heart to God as in a constant communication with Him.”

Reflecting on your daily to-do’s, where can you find moments to lift up your heart to God? ❤️‍🔥

It’s still not too late to join @rheawahlberg in discovering more of the incredible story of St. Elizabeth Ann Seton.

“Fill yourself with confidence. The Mother we have is the Mother of God, the most Blessed Virgin, the Queen of Heaven and Earth.” - St. Josemaria Escriva 👑

Today we celebrate the Queenship of the Blessed Virgin Mary, where we honor her unique role in salvation as the Mother of God. Shortly after she was assumed, she was crowned Queen of Heaven and Earth! 🌍 

Celebrate this special day by praying the joyful mysteries of the Rosary today on Hallow! 🙏

#queenshipoftheblessedvirginmary

Announcing the last Saint in this year’s #Saintsin7Days series, Blessed Pier Giorgio Frassati! This week’s series will be guided by @father_david_michael, a priest in the Diocese of Houston!

Known for his joyful spirit and deep faith, Bl. Pier Giorgio Frassati embodied the Beatitudes in his daily life. He was born into a privileged Italian family, but he chose a life of service to the poor. A passionate mountaineer and athlete, he found joy in both physical and spiritual pursuits. 🏔️

Next week’s story will be incredible for developing the virtues of humility and charity, which Blessed Frassati exemplified. 🙌

“Jesus is with me. I have nothing to fear.” - Blessed Pier Giorgio Frassati

One of Bl. Pier Giorgio’s friends said, “Pier Giorgio loved human beings one by one, face by face, name by name, each person with his own unique voice, his own heavy breathing, his own wrinkles, his own bad mood.” 🤍

Pier Giorgio showed each person he interacted with respect for their human dignity, which is something we should all strive to do. 

We can’t wait to dive deeper into the life of this future Saint in our final #Saintsin7Days challenge this coming Monday, August 26th. 😇

“Suffering that is nourished by the flame of faith becomes something beautiful, because it tempers the soul to deal with suffering.” - Bl. Pier Giorgio Frassati 🕯️ 

#blessedpiergiorgiofrassati

Tomorrow we begin our journey alongside @father_david_michael through the story of Bl. Pier Giorgio Frassati! 😇

In Pier Giorgio, we find an ordinary lay adult who pursued holiness in a way that makes sainthood realistic. We can read his letters and even see photographs taken during his hikes! ⛰️

Rather than feeling like a distant historical figure, Frassati feels more like a friend who shows us how we can live the Gospel heroically in our world today. ✝️

Join the waitlist for tomorrow!

Blessed Pier Giorgio Frassati, pray for us 🙏

Bl. Pier Giorgio Frassati is and always will be HIM. His unwavering belief in the dignity of every human being and his tireless efforts to promote peace and equality have made him a beloved figure in the Catholic Church and a powerful inspiration to people around the world. For the next 7 days, @father_david_michael is walking us through his life over on the @hallowapp and I highly encourage you to join me this week in learning more about Bl. Pier Giorgio.

I’m leading a prayer and meditation on the life of Blessed Pier Giorgio Frassati on the @hallowapp starting today! 🙏 As a part of the Saints in 7 Days challenge, we’re going to pray through different moments of Frassati’s life each day. Most importantly, we’re going to grow closer to God. Check the link in bio to download the app and join the challenge. I hope to see you there! ⛰️🙏
#blpiergiorgiofrassati #saintsin7days #prayer #hallowpartner

#Saintsin7Days continues today, where we look at Blessed Frassati’s childhood, specifically the formation of his Catholic faith. Despite his parent’s resistance and worry that he would become a priest, he convinced them to let him receive the Eucharist as a child. ✝️

He spent the rest of his life faithfully receiving Holy Communion, conforming himself more and more to the love of Jesus. His love, perseverance, and courage is something for everyone to aspire to. 🩵

“Heavenly Father, Give me the courage to strive for the highest goals, to flee every temptation to be mediocre. Enable me to aspire to greatness, as Pier Giorgio did, and to open my heart with joy to Your call to holiness. Free me from the fear of failure. I want to be, Lord, firmly and forever united to You. Grant me the graces I ask You through Pier Giorgio’s intercession, by the merits of Our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.” 🙏 

“Verso L’Alto!” - Blessed Pier Giorgio Frassati 🏔️

#blessedfrassati

Today is the feast day of Saint Monica. Saint Monica is revered for her unwavering faith and intercession in the conversion of her son, Saint Augustine. Despite her husband’s opposition and her son’s rebellious ways, Monica remained steadfast in her Christian faith. ✝️

She prayed tirelessly for their conversion and her story is a testament to the power of prayer. She is the patron saint of alcoholics, converts, and those seeking the conversion of loved ones. 🙏

Are you praying for someone’s conversion?

“Nothing is far from God.” - St. Monica #FeastDay 💜

#saintmonica

“To fall in love with God is the greatest romance; to seek him the greatest adventure; to find him, the greatest human achievement.” - St. Augustine #FeastDay 🙏

Yesterday we celebrated the Feast of St. Monica, who prayed fervently for her son’s conversion. Today, we celebrate the life of her son St. Augustine of Hippo, Doctor of the Church. 
Augustine’s journey to faith had many twists and turns, marked by sin and struggle. Confessions, arguably his most notable autobiographical work, explores his spiritual journey and the transformative power of God’s grace. 📖

After his conversion, Augustine became a bishop and a prolific theologian. He is considered one of the greatest theologians of the Church. 🖋️

“What God does in people’s lives when we just give him 10 minutes is just incredible.” - Alex Jones 🕰️

🕊️Gratitude with @markwahlberg

Join us for Day 1!

When you look at the probable number of months you have left in your life and realize just how much time you might waste plugged into a screen, it makes you that much more motivated to find a way to regulate this problem. A few suggestions I would make would be to:
1. Utilize the screen-time restriction in your phone’s settings or download a screen-time limiting app 
2. Ensure that, if you’re going to use a smartphone, the apps that you use are actually improving your life and not dismantling your focus.

Pray Lectio Divina with @fathermikeschmitz and @jeffcavins on Day 2 of How to Pray! Get closer to God today with Sacred Scripture. 📖🙏

How to pray Lectio Divina:

1️⃣ Lectio (Read): With Hallow, listen carefully to the Bible verse.
2️⃣ Meditatio (Meditate): Notice what stands out to you in the verse and let that be your focus. 
3️⃣ Oratio (Pray): Ask God to show you what He wants you to take from the verse.
4️⃣ Contemplatio (Contemplate): Allow yourself to rest fully in God’s presence.

“Come to me, all you that are weary and are carrying heavy burdens, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.” (Matthew 11:28-30) 🐑

#lectiodivina

Today, we remember the lives lost on 9/11. Our prayers are with all those affected. 🙏 #NeverForget 🇺🇸

Today in How to Pray, we’re meditating on gratitude with @markwahlberg! 🙏

Life can be challenging, but we don’t have to face it alone. With Him by our side, even the heaviest loads feel lighter, and it’s important to express thanks, especially during difficult times.

“Praise the Lord of lords; for his mercy endures forever; Who alone has done great wonders, for his mercy endures forever.”

What are you grateful for today? Let us know in the comments below! ⬇️

Today, in How to Pray, we learn the words that Jesus revealed to Fr. Dolindo, Padre Pio’s spiritual director, to help him surrender everything to God. ✝️

🙏 In the Surrender Novena, we turn away from ourselves and towards Jesus, who wraps us in His arms and takes care of everything in His everlasting love. Turn to this prayer whenever you struggle to take care of something on your own or give over a worry, doubt, or suffering to God. 

Learn the Surrender Novena alongside @jonathanroumieofficial in today’s session and close with this inspiring prayer from St. Ignatius of Loyola:

“Take, Lord, and receive all my liberty, my memory, my understanding and my entire will, all I have and call my own.” 💙

We pray the Litany of Humility in How to Pray today with @frjoshjohnson to ask God to grace us with more humility. 🙏

This is a virtue we really admire, but it is also one of the most challenging to practice. People often think humility is making yourself small, “less than,” and lowering your self-esteem, but this isn’t the kind of humility that Christ, the disciples, Mary, and the Saints have shown us! 😇

Instead, we pray that we desire a humility that exudes love and tenderness, that knows we are all created equal in the image of God, and that understands our service in this earthly life is to love others beyond everything else. ❤️

“From the desire of being esteemed
From the desire of being loved
️From the desire of being extolled
From the desire of being honored
From the desire of being praised
From the desire of being preferred to others …

Deliver me, Jesus.”

In the Gospels, St. Matthew sat in the tax collector’s booth when Jesus saw him and called him. Jesus said, “Follow me,” and Matthew left everything behind – security, status, and power – to follow Jesus.

St. Matthew is a great example of living out the faith despite worldly comforts. The Beatitudes are among the most influential teachings in the Gospel of Matthew, found in the first chapter in a section of Jesus’ teachings known as the Sermon on the Mount. ⛰️

“Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.” (Matthew 5:3) #FeastDay 🙏 👑

📚Did you know that Matthew is also the patron saint of bookkeepers and bankers?

We’re so excited to start our newest challenge tomorrow, Praying Together, a free 5-day challenge with Fr. Frankie Cicero (@lifestartshere_fire), a priest of the Diocese of Phoenix and the founder of Life Starts Here Ministries. 🙌

This challenge is all about why we should pray together and just how powerful praying in the Church can be. 🙏 Over the next 5 days, we will go over:

💜The importance of praying together
💜Praying with others
💜Praying for others
💜Fellowship
💜Evangelization

We’re also super excited to share new, community features on the Hallow app! Now, you can join your parish and invite friends and family to join your church on Hallow. ⛪️ We’re super passionate about building real and vibrant communities of prayer, and we hope you’ll join us today in this new challenge!

“Amen, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. Again, [amen,] I say to you, if two of you agree on earth about anything for which they are to pray, it shall be granted to them by my heavenly Father. For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.” (Matthew 18:18-20) 👫
#PrayingTogether

It’s Day 1 of Praying Together with Fr. Frankie Cicero @lifestartshere_fire! 🙏

This 5-day challenge is all about coming together as communities to pray together. Reflecting on the question: Why is it important that we pray together? Why can’t we just spend time with the Lord on our own; isn’t that enough? 👫

If you joined us for How to Pray, this challenge takes the prayer methods we’ve learned about and practiced together to the next level. And what better day to start than today’s Feast of St. Padre Pio? 

We’re reminded of when he said, “Today’s society does not pray [together], that is why it is falling apart.” - Padre Pio ⛪️

Over the next 5 days, Fr. Frankie will take us through Scripture, testimonies from the saints, and his personal experiences in communal prayer. We hope you’ll join us!! 🙏

#PrayingTogether

“The family that prays together, stays together”

Today, we will hear the tale of a simple, hard working Irishman who changed the world with his devotion to Our Blessed Mother and the rosary. Father Patrick Peyton spent his life championing the power of prayer through his rosary crusades in forty countries drawing a total of 28 million people together in prayer. Through his passionate work, he became known and loved by millions. But, through it all he remained a simple, humble and devoted man of God, and committed the entirety of his life to spreading one simple message: “The family that prays together, stays together”.

If you want to learn more about this amazing man, go check out the powerful documentary about his life, @praythefilm !

“Private prayer is like straw scattered here and there: If you set it on fire, it makes a lot of little flames. But gather these straws into a bundle and light them, and you get a mighty fire, rising like a column into the sky; public prayer is like that.” - St. John Vianney 🕯️

Learn ways to pray in community with Fr. Frankie Cicero on this 5-day challenge, Praying Together! 🙏 @lifestartshere_fire

Today, Fr. Frankie will go over the importance of praying together and tangible ways we can pray with others everyday. He will also show us how to use new tools on the Hallow app to encourage prayer in community! 📲

#PrayingTogether

We’ve seen plenty of places in Scripture where intercessory prayer facilitates God’s miracles, and in today’s session, Fr. Frankie guides us through one and leads us through prayer! 📖

In Day 3 of Praying Together, Fr. Frankie Cicero (@lifestartshere_fire ) shares the power of community prayer by reciting a miraculous story from his own life. ⛪️🙏

Come celebrate the feast of Saint Therese by listening to our episode on her life! Her little way paved the path to sainthood over a hundred years ago. Saint Therese didn’t die a martyr or lead thousands into battle but she is one of the most well-known and loved saints of our modern time. She left us with the story of her soul, her little way and is one of the four female Doctors of the church. Her story is one you don’t want to miss!

*In this episode, we mistakenly said that Therese met with Pope Leo VIII, but she actually met with Pope Leo XIII

Month of the Rosary, led by @fr_burke_masters - chaplain for the Chicago Cubs, starts today! ❤️🙏

“Countless families the world over invite Mary into their homes through the family Rosary. She comes. They sense her presence. They solve their problems because where Mary is present, there is Christ, her Divine Son.” - Fr. Patrick Peyton 

🙏💜 #MonthoftheRosary

Why should we make an effort to pray the Rosary this month?

🙏 Even if we are tired or distracted, the words of the Rosary are still biblical and holy.
🙏 It is a meditation on the life of Jesus Christ.
🙏 It’s a way to seek Mary’s intercession and guidance. 
🙏 It’s a source of peace and comfort 

It’s not too late to join us every day in October for our Month of the Rosary challenge with @fr_burke_masters!

“You must ask for God’s help. Even when you have done so, it may seem to you for a long time that no help, or less help than you need, is being given. Never mind. After each failure, ask forgiveness, pick yourself up, and try again. Very often what God first helps us towards is not the virtue itself but just this power of always trying again.” - C.S. Lewis, Mere Christianity 🙏

Join us for the start of our newest challenge exploring the book Mere Christianity by C.S. Lewis!

Each day, this challenge will feature powerful quotes from the book read by @beargrylls and further explained by Fr. Gregory Pine, concluding with a personal reflection. 📕

How much of a difference can one person make? 

In the 1940s, amidst the turmoil of World War II, a brilliant English mind was invited to share his thoughts on the radio. His 15-minute BBC broadcasts, filled with mystical insights, profoundly impacted listeners. Today, only a single audio reel remains, preserving his voice.

Let's consider a common spiritual dilemma: With billions of Christians praying to God, how can He possibly attend to each of us individually? The man responded by explaining God's infinite attention, so much that it's as if we were the only person He had ever created.

Following his BBC series, this remarkable individual, C.S. Lewis, compiled his thoughts into a timeless classic, "Mere Christianity." This book offers a clear and accessible exploration of the core tenets of Christianity. Whether you're new to the faith or seeking to deepen your understanding, "Mere Christianity" is a valuable resource.

You can embark on this journey through this book with the @hallowapp Each day, @beargrylls and Fr. Gregory Pine will guide you through a passage, offering commentary and discussion and every Sunday, Fr. Gregory Pine and @mattfradd will have a discussion on the book. To start your 3-month free trial, visit the link in bio!

It’s Day 1! Join @beargrylls, Fr. Gregory Pine, and @mattfradd along this journey through the incredible work of C.S. Lewis. 🧭

Dive into the heart of faith with Mere Christianity. ✝️ This classic guide is perfect for anyone seeking a clear, relatable explanation of God, free will, and what it means to live as a Christian. 

Today, we’ll learn about C.S. Lewis and how Christianity addresses the popular worldview of materialism. 🌎

We can’t wait to see you there!

#MereChristianity

Happy feast day to Hallow’s patron saint, St. Teresa of Ávila! #FeastDay 🙏💜

This saint was a Carmelite sister in the 16th century. She was a mystic and focused on deep contemplative prayer. Her life was marked by incredible faith and a strong desire to serve God. ✝️

Some of her writings, including her autobiography and the book “The Interior Castle,” profoundly impacted the Church’s theology, leading her to become a Doctor of the Church. 🏰

St. Teresa’s reforms within the Carmelite Order emphasized prayer, contemplation, and a simpler lifestyle, and she founded numerous Carmelite convents throughout Spain. She is the patron saint of Spain, those in religious orders, sickness, and more. 🇪🇸

To celebrate this feast day, pray the St. Teresa Novena on Hallow!

“You pay God a compliment by asking great things of Him.”

❤️‍🔥“I need nothing but God and to lose myself in the heart of Jesus” 

🎧Happy feast day of Saint Margaret Mary Alacoque! To celebrate her feast day, listen to the two part Saints Alive episode on her life!

In our first episode, we’ll meet Jane and Sarah: two sisters taking refuge in an English convent during the second world war. Though they are surrounded by the confusion and fear of war, they find solace and hope when Sister Evelyn tells them the incredible story of Saint Margaret Mary Alacoque. Come listen with Jane and Sarah and learn more about the beauty and peace found in Jesus’ Sacred Heart. 

Parental Guidance Note: The start of this episode takes place during WWII. To skip these scenes for little listeners, start the story at 9:15.

“He Himself is the fuel our spirits were designed to burn, or the food our spirits were designed to feed on. There is no other.” -C.S. Lewis, Mere Christianity 💜

It’s Day 2 of the Mere Christianity challenge with @beargrylls, Fr. Gregory Pine, and @mattfradd! Today, we’re exploring the question of whether objective morality exists and, if it does, then what does that mean for us? It’s not too late to jump in! 🙏

“Blessed are you who believed that what was spoken to you by the Lord would be fulfilled.” (Luke 1:45) 🙏

Today, we celebrate St. Luke the Evangelist! 💜 #FeastDay

St. Luke is best known for his contributions to the New Testament. St. Paul refers to him as “the beloved physician” in his Letter to the Colossians (Col. 4:14) 🩺

As the patron saint of physicians, surgeons, and artists, Luke is also celebrated for his artistic talent, particularly his paintings of the Blessed Virgin Mary. 🎨

His descriptions of Mary’s life in the Gospel reflect his unique perspective in the Bible.

Being a Gentile and not Jewish, Luke emphasized in his Gospel the universality of salvation won by Christ. He is the only Gentile who has written books in the Bible. 📖

Today is World Mission Sunday, the annual celebration that unites Catholics worldwide in prayer and support for the Church’s missions! 🌎 #WorldMissionSunday

This year’s theme is “Go and Invite Everyone to the Banquet,” reminding us to share God’s love with the world. Pope Francis reminds us that missionary work is a calling to everyone. Let’s answer this call together! 🙏

“Instead of seeming to impose new obligations, [we] should appear as people who wish to share their joy, who point to a horizon of beauty, and who invite others to a delicious banquet.” - Pope Francis ✝️

“Until you have given up your self to Him you will not have a real self. Sameness is to be found most among the most ‘natural’ men, not among those who surrender to Christ.” 🙏 - CS Lewis, Mere Christianity @cslewis_official

“There is no evil to be faced that Christ does not face with us. There is no enemy that Christ has not already conquered. There is no cross to bear that Christ has not already borne for us, and does not now bear with us.” - Pope St. John Paul II #FeastDay 🙏

😇 Did you know that in his time as pope, he canonized 482 saints?

🕊️ One of his most influential writings is Theology of the Body, where he taught that the body is a gift from God and is meant to be used in a way that is consistent with this truth.

🗺️ He was also known for his travel around the world and the start of World Youth Day! 

In honor of his feast day today, we invite you to listen to the Witness to Hope Challenge or pray along with the voice of Pope St. John Paul II in his address to young people in 1987 on the app!

In this prayer challenge, we’ll reflect on inspiring quotes from our Founding Fathers, meditate on powerful words of Sacred Scripture, and hear beautiful reflections on what it means to put God first during this time. 📚

Let’s take this duty seriously as we all unite in prayer that God’s will be done this election season. 🗳️

“As we enter Heaven, we will see them, so many of them, coming towards us and thanking us. We will ask who they are, and they will say ‘a poor soul you prayed for in purgatory.’” – Ven. Fulton Sheen #AllSoulsDay 🕊️

Today, we remember and pray for all the faithful departed. 🙏

We invite you to pray for all souls, especially for your loved ones who have passed. Consider praying a Rosary, Divine Mercy Chaplet, or even beginning a novena on Hallow to honor them.

These past few weeks and months in our country have been filled with debate, with passion, and often with fear. While it’s important to be knowledgeable about important civic issues, we often forget to invite prayer into it. 🙏 

Let’s bring prayer back into everyone’s hearts this season. Join us this week in praying with our challenge ‘One Nation Under God!’ ❤️

Over the next five days, we’re going to invite God into everything so that He may guide us at all times.

Each day will start off with guest @neal_mcdonough, who will be joined by some incredible voices including:

🇺🇸 Fr. Josh Johnson @frjoshjohnson
🇺🇸 Fr. Dave Pivonka (President of Franciscan University) @franciscanpresident
🇺🇸 Katie McGrady (Catholic radio show host) @katiepmcgrady
🇺🇸 Montse Alvarado (President and COO of EWTN News) @montseewtn
🇺🇸 Sr. Norma Pimentel

“Who are they that fear the Lord? He will teach them the way that they should choose. They will abide in prosperity, and their children shall possess the land.” (Psalm 25:12-13)

“Lord, we trust in you. We give to you everything - our leaders, our president, our country. We give it all to you.” 🙏🇺🇸

Join us for Day 1 and the rest of this week in our newest community challenge, One Nation Under God. We’ll come together in prayer for our country, our leaders, and each other – for wisdom, discernment, and the courage to do God’s will. 🙏🇺🇸

Today, start with a reflection by @neal_mcdonough and a prayer led by @frjoshjohnson. Throughout the rest of the week, Neal and other special guests will help us bring prayer back into the heart of this important week.

#prayer #OneNationUnderGod

“And we ask you, God, in these days of emotional tension, when the problems of the world are gigantic in extent and chaotic in detail, to be with us in our going out and our coming in, in our rising up and in our lying down, in our moments of joy and in our moments of sorrow, until the day when there shall be no sunset and no dawn.” - Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. 🙏🇺🇸

This week is such a pivotal moment for the nation, so it is crucial to remember that the gospel calls us to love our neighbor. 👥 

Tomorrow, we will meditate on a powerful passage from the Book of Wisdom with @katiepmcgrady that reminds us of God’s guiding hand. We’ll also read a humbling quote from Abraham Lincoln and pray a part of the Surrender Novena.

We hope you’ll join us in praying for our country tomorrow! 🤍

#prayer #OneNationUnderGod

Jesus, we surrender ourselves to You. 🙏🇺🇸

#OneNationUnderGod #prayer #surrender

This evening, many might feel stress and anxiety. Let’s continue to surrender everything to Him in prayer - asking Him for peace and unity in our country and to guide our leaders. 🙏💙

“Give me Wisdom, the consort at your throne, and do not reject me from among your children.” (Wisdom 9:4)

Continue praying with us until the last day of this challenge on Friday! Please join us tomorrow to continue praying for our country. 🇺🇸🙏✝️

#onenationundergod #prayer

Thank you to all those who joined our live praying the Rosary for our country. 🇺🇸

Let’s continue to surrender everything to Him in prayer. 🙏 Please join us tomorrow for Day 3 in our prayer challenge “One Nation Under God” to continue praying. ✝️

#prayer

We are here today to remember that we are a people of God, not of this world. Politics is important, but God must always come first. God alone is our Savior. Christ alone is our King. ✝️

In today’s session, @nealmcdonough reads Matthew 22, where Jesus tells the Pharisees that we are made in the image and likeness of God. Therefore, we belong to Him only. 🤍

The Roman coin bears Caesar’s image and inscription, but where do we see God’s image? Where do we see God’s inscription? We are not just made in the image and likeness of God, but we are His living, breathing image in the world, entrusted with the responsibility to reflect His love and grace. 🙏

#advent #adventprayer

As we conclude this week, we’re going to shift our focus to the calling that God has for each of us—namely, the call to serve. Whether we hold office or not, all of us have the call and responsibility to serve our brothers and sisters in our local communities. 💜

Our words and actions, however small, if they come from a heart of prayer, can transform the culture around us. Through prayer, we enter into union with God, and He aligns our hearts and minds with His. 🌎 

Through prayer, God leads us to wisdom and compassion to carry out His will. When we give our efforts and labors over to Him, He multiplies them. “Let us not grow tired of doing good, for in due time we shall reap our harvest if we do not give up.” (Galatians 6:9) 🙏

#onenationundergod #prayer

📣 We’ve had such a hard time keeping quiet about this announcement … 

🎄This Advent, we’ll dive deep into one of the most powerful verses in the Bible. “For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him might not perish but might have eternal life.” (John 3:16)

“I will go anywhere and do anything in order to communicate the love of Jesus to those who do not know Him or have forgotten Him.” - St. Frances Xavier Cabrini #FeastDay 💙

Today, we celebrate the feast day of St. Frances Xavier Cabrini, a remarkable saint who dedicated her life to serving the most vulnerable. ✝️

Born in Italy in 1850, despite suffering from illness, she founded the Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart to care for immigrants, orphans, and the sick.

Her compassion led her to establish 67 institutions across continents, providing education, healthcare, and a haven for those in need.⚕️📚

Also known as “Mother of Immigrants,” she is a powerful reminder of the importance of prayer and striving to be more like Christ. 🙏

Spend some time today listening to her Saint Story on Hallow!
